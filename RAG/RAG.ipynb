      "Abstract \n",
      "Dental template and parametric dental models are important tools for various applications in digital dentistry. How- \n",
      "ever, constructing an unbiased dental template and accurate parametric dental models remains a challenging task due \n",
      "to the complex anatomical and morphological dental structures and also low volume ratio of the teeth. In this study, \n",
      "we develop an unbiased dental template by constructing an accurate dental atlas from CBCT images with guidance \n",
      "of teeth segmentation. First, to address the challenges, we propose to enhance the CBCT images and their segmen- \n",
      "tation images, including image cropping, image masking and segmentation intensity reassigning. Then, we further \n",
      "use the segmentation images to perform co-registration with the CBCT images to generate an accurate dental atlas, \n",
      "from which an unbiased dental template can be generated. By leveraging the unbiased dental template, we construct \n",
      "parametric dental models by estimating point-to-point correspondences between the dental models and employing \n",
      "Principal Component Analysis to determine shape subspaces of the parametric dental models. A total of 159 CBCT \n",
      "images of real subjects are collected to perform the constructions. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of \n",
      "our proposed method in constructing unbiased dental template and parametric dental model. The developed dental \n",

      "Dental template is a standardized, three-dimensional \n",
      "(3D) representation of a typical dental model. It usually \n",
      "serves as a valuable tool for spatial normalization and spa- \n",
      "tial correspondence estimation across different subjects \n",
      "for dental disease diagnosis and treatment planning in \n",
      "many dental applications, such as dental implant plan- \n",
      "ning and orthodontic treatment planning [5]. However, \n",
      "currently, there is still no dental template that can repre- \n",
      "sent population-average dental structures without subject- \n",
      "biases, i.e., unbiased dental template. This is because it \n",
      "is still challenging to construct an unbiased dental tem- \n",
      "plate despite advances in dental imaging technologies, as \n",
      "explained below. First, the maxilla and mandible that \n",
      "support the upper and lower rows of teeth, have compli- \n",
      "cated anatomical and morphological structures. Second, \n",
      "the volume ratio of teeth with respect to the whole im- \n",
      "age is small. These two factors make it challenging to \n",
      "accurately construct the unbiased dental template. Pre- \n",
      "viously, researchers were limited to using biased dental \n",
      "templates, such as artificial templates or selected subject \n",
      "templates, which could potentially influence the accuracy \n",
      "of the final results. For example, Barone et al. created \n",
      "a digital dental template from a reference physical model \n",
      "to reconstruct complete 3D teeth model from panoramic \n",
      "radiographs [6]. Wu et al. artistically designed templates \n",
      "for four categories of teeth (i.e., incisors, canines, pre- \n",
      "molars and molars), and used these templates to fit the \n",
      "the teeth model in the plaster cast scans [7]. Pei et al. \n",
      "created a 3D dental template by digitizing the teeth spec- \n",
      "imens used in dental clinics, and applied it to constrain \n",
      "tooth segmentation from CBCT images [8]. Gholamal- \n",
      "izadeh et al. randomly selected a typical dental model as \n",
      "the reference dental template for spatial alignment [5]. To \n",
      "learn the tooth arrangement in digital orthodontics, Wei \n",
      "et al. normalized the position and orientation of different \n",
      "dental models by defining a local coordinate system on \n",
      "each model and aligning it with the world coordinate sys- \n",
      "tem [9]. An unbiased dental template would improve the \n",
      "normalization of dental models, thus resulting in higher \n",
      "prediction accuracy of deep learning methods [10]. \n",
      "Parametric dental models, which describe shape and \n",
      "position variations of dental models in a population, also \n",
      "have broad applications in digital dentistry, such as teeth \n",
      "segmentation [11], dental mesh repairing [12] and 3D \n",
      "teeth reconstruction [13, 7]. The construction of paramet- \n",
      "ric dental models involves the following steps [14, 15]: (1) \n",
      "rigidly aligning all the dental models to a common space, \n",
      "(2) estimating the point-to-point correspondence between \n",
      "the aligned dental models and (3) employing Principal \n",
      "Component Analysis (PCA) [16] to determine subspaces \n",
      "of the parametric dental models. However, the accuracy \n",
      "of existing parametric dental models is limited due to the \n",
      "lack of an unbiased dental template, which is essential for \n",
      "precise spatial alignment and point-to-point correspon- \n",
      "dence estimation. Without an unbiased template, the con- \n",
      "struction of parametric dental models becomes challeng- \n",
      "ing, and the resulting models may contain subject-specific \n",
      "biases. Therefore, the development of an unbiased dental \n",
      "template is crucial for construction of accurate parametric \n",
      "dental models and for improving dental image processing \n",
      "and analysis. \n",
      "Anatomical atlases, i.e., population-average anatomi- \n",
      "cal structures, have been widely used as unbiased tem- \n",
      "plates for medical image processing and analysis [17]. \n",
      "These templates provide a population-average representa- \n",
      "tion of typical shapes and locations of a specific anatomi- \n",
      "cal structure, while maintaining high cross-individual va- \n",
      "lidity within the population [18]. Therefore, the unbiased \n",
      "template is an effective tool for medical image process- \n",
      "ing, like spatial normalization and spatial correspondence \n",
      "estimation across different subjects. Over the years, nu- \n",
      "merous unbiased templates of different anatomies have \n",
      "been constructed for various medical applications. For \n",
      "instance, Rajashekar et al. constructed FLAIR MRI and \n",
      "noncontrast computed tomography (CT) atlases of elderly \n",
      "populations for clinical applications [17]. Chen et al. de- \n",
      "veloped a 4D infant brain atlas for dynamic brain devel- \n",
      "opment analysis during infancy [18]. Additionally, Lee \n",
      "et al. created a CT atlas of cardiac disease understanding \n",
      "and abdominal atlas for integration of tissue information \n",
      "in different scales [19]. \n",
      "In this paper, we develop an unbiased dental template \n",
      "by constructing an accurate dental atlas from CBCT im- \n",
      "ages. To address the challenges of complex adjacent \n",
      "anatomical structures and low volume ratio, we propose \n",
      "to enhance CBCT images and their teeth segmentation \n",
      "images through image cropping, image masking and seg- \n",

      "tion framework to generate an unbiased dental template. \n",
      "The evaluation results show that the constructed unbiased \n",
      "dental template outperforms the selected dental template, \n",
      "which has subjective bias. This indicates that our unbi- \n",
      "ased dental template has more typical shapes and location \n",
      "information of teeth and higher cross-individual validity \n",
      "than the biased template, thus facilitate image processing \n",
      "and analysis in digital dentistry.   Besides teeth labeling \n",
      "in the evaluation, the unbiased dental template can also \n",
      "be applied to various digital dentistry applications, such \n",
      "as spatial alignment of teeth models (images) and corre- \n",
