"Towards Earlier Detection of Oral Diseases On Smartphones Using Oral and
  Dental RGB Images","Ayush Garg, Julia Lu, Anika Maji","Oral diseases such as periodontal (gum) diseases and dental caries (cavities)
affect billions of people across the world today. However, previous
state-of-the-art models have relied on X-ray images to detect oral diseases,
making them inaccessible to remote monitoring, developing countries, and
telemedicine. To combat this overuse of X-ray imagery, we propose a lightweight
machine learning model capable of detecting calculus (also known as hardened
plaque or tartar) in RGB images while running efficiently on low-end devices.
The model, a modified MobileNetV3-Small neural network transfer learned from
ImageNet, achieved an accuracy of 72.73% (which is comparable to
state-of-the-art solutions) while still being able to run on mobile devices due
to its reduced memory requirements and processing times. A ResNet34-based model
was also constructed and achieved an accuracy of 81.82%. Both of these models
were tested on a mobile app, demonstrating their potential to limit the number
of serious oral disease cases as their predictions can help patients schedule
appointments earlier without the need to go to the clinic.",2023-08-30T02:01:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15705v1,gum disease
"Oral-3D: Reconstructing the 3D Bone Structure of Oral Cavity from 2D
  Panoramic X-ray","Weinan Song, Yuan Liang, Jiawei Yang, Kun Wang, Lei He","Panoramic X-ray (PX) provides a 2D picture of the patient's mouth in a
panoramic view to help dentists observe the invisible disease inside the gum.
However, it provides limited 2D information compared with cone-beam computed
tomography (CBCT), another dental imaging method that generates a 3D picture of
the oral cavity but with more radiation dose and a higher price. Consequently,
it is of great interest to reconstruct the 3D structure from a 2D X-ray image,
which can greatly explore the application of X-ray imaging in dental surgeries.
In this paper, we propose a framework, named Oral-3D, to reconstruct the 3D
oral cavity from a single PX image and prior information of the dental arch.
Specifically, we first train a generative model to learn the cross-dimension
transformation from 2D to 3D. Then we restore the shape of the oral cavity with
a deformation module with the dental arch curve, which can be obtained simply
by taking a photo of the patient's mouth. To be noted, Oral-3D can restore both
the density of bony tissues and the curved mandible surface. Experimental
results show that Oral-3D can efficiently and effectively reconstruct the 3D
oral structure and show critical information in clinical applications, e.g.,
tooth pulling and dental implants. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to explore this domain transformation problem between these two imaging
methods.",2020-03-18T18:02:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08413v4,gum disease
"Investigating biomechanical determinants of endothelial permeability in
  a modified hollow fibre bioreactor","Stephen G Gray, Peter D Weinberg","Effects of mechanical stress on the permeability of vascular endothelium are
important to normal physiology and may be critical in the development of
atherosclerosis, where they can account for the patchy arterial distribution of
the disease. Such properties are frequently investigated in vitro. Here we
evaluate and use the hollow fibre bioreactor for this purpose; in this system,
endothelial cells form a confluent monolayer lining numerous plastic
capillaries with porous walls, contained in a cartridge. The capillaries were
perfused with a near-aortic waveform by an external pump, and permeability was
assessed by the movement of rhodamine-labelled albumin from the intracapillary
space to the extracapillary space. Confluence and quiescence of the cells was
confirmed by electron microscopy and measurements of glucose consumption and
permeability. The system was able to detect previously established influences
on permeability: tracer transport was increased by acute application of shear
stress and decreased by chronic shear stress compared to a static control, and
was increased by thrombin or an NO synthase inhibitor under chronic shear.
Increasing viscosity by addition of xanthan gum reduced permeability under both
acute and chronic shear. Addition of damping chambers to reduce flow
pulsatility increased permeability. Modifying the cartridge to allow chronic
convection across the monolayer increased effective permeability more than
could be explained the addition of convective transport alone, indicating that
it caused an increase in permeability. The off-the-shelf hollow fibre
bioreactor provides an excellent system for investigating the biomechanics of
endothelial permeability and its potential is increased by simple
modifications.",2023-03-02T18:27:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01466v1,gum disease
Scatter broadening of pulsars in the direction of the Gum nebula,"D. Mitra, R. Ramachandran","We have measured the scatter broadening of pulsars in the direction of the

scattering properties across the Gum nebula. The IRAS-Vela shell is shown to be

Superconductivity in Al-Nb-Ti-V-Zr multicomponent alloy,"Yuta Harayama, Jiro Kitagawa","The superconducting high-entropy alloys (HEAs) recently attract considerable
attention due to their exciting properties, such as the robustness of
superconductivity against atomic disorder and extremely high-pressure. The
well-studied crystal structure of superconducting HEAs is body-centered-cubic
(bcc) containing Nb, Ti, and Zr atoms. The same elements are contained in
Al5Nb24Ti40V5Zr26, which is a recently discovered bcc HEA and shows a
gum-metal-like behavior after cold rolling. The gum metal is also an
interesting system, exhibiting superelasticity and low Young's modulus. If gum
metals show superconductivity and can be used as a superconducting wire, the
gum-metal HEA superconductors might be the next-generation superconducting wire
materials. Aiming at a fundamental assessment of as-cast Al-Nb-Ti-V-Zr
multicomponent alloys including Al5Nb24Ti40V5Zr26, we have investigated the
structural and superconducting properties of the alloys. All alloys
investigated show the superconductivity, and the valence electron concentration
dependence of the superconducting critical temperature is very close to those
of typical superconducting bcc HEAs.",2021-07-19T22:58:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09187v1,gum disease
"Massive star formation in the Carina nebula complex and Gum 31 -- II. a
  cloud-cloud collision in Gum 31","Shinji Fujita, Hidetoshi Sano, Rei Enokiya, Katsuhiro Hayashi, Mikito Kohno, Kisetsu Tsuge, Kengo Tachihara, Atsushi Nishimura, Akio Ohama, Yumiko Yamane, Takahiro Ohno, Rin I. Yamada, Yasuo Fukui","We present the results of analyses of the 12CO (J=1-0), 13CO (J=1-0), and
12CO (J=2-1) emission data toward Gum 31. Three molecular clouds separated in
velocity were detected at -25, -20, and -10 km/s . The velocity structure of
the molecular clouds in Gum 31 cannot be interpreted as expanding motion. Two
of them, the -25 km/s cloud and the -20 km/s cloud, are likely associated with
Gum 31, because their 12CO (J=2-1)/12CO (J=1-0) intensity ratios are high. We
found that these two clouds show the observational signatures of cloud-cloud
collisions (CCCs): a complementary spatial distribution and a V-shaped
structure (bridge features) in the position-velocity diagram. In addition,
their morphology and velocity structures are very similar to the numerical
simulations conducted by the previous studies. We propose a scenario that the
-25 km/s cloud and the -20 km/s cloud were collided and triggered the formation
of the massive star system HD 92206 in Gum 31. This scenario can explain the
offset of the stars from the center and the morphology of Gum 31
simultaneously. The timescale of the collision was estimated to be ~1 Myr by
using the ratio between the path length of the collision and the assumed
velocity separation. This is consistent with that of the CCCs in Carina Nebula
Complex in our previous study.",2021-07-13T08:18:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06671v2,gum disease
Monte Carlo uncertainty estimation for wavelength calibration,"Thang H. L., Nguyen D. D., Dung D. N.","CIPM published the Supplement I for GUM in 2008 as not only an alternative
approach to estimate the uncertainty for a given calibration measurement but
also as a proper uncertainty estimation one, whenever any of the conditions
imposed in GUM which must be satisfied does not hold [1, 2]. Before the
introduction of the new approach in the Supplement I, namely Monte Carlo (MC)
method, the GUM rules have been always applied even if in cases where the
mentioned conditions were not fulfilled. After or even before the official
introduction of this MC method, a number of published papers in uncertainty
estimation by using MC method had been shown up, giving more insight for the
ways the uncertainties estimated and also for the specific calibration
measurements under investigation themselves [3 - 16]. However, in most of those
published papers, the application conditions required before a method selection
should be analyzed, in fact, has been ignored. In our uncertainty study for
wavelength calibration by using beat frequency technique, the application
conditions have not been ignored but analyzed carefully and it was found that a
GUM application condition was unsatisfactory. However, all the MC method
conditions for this calibration problem have been well fulfilled. A computer
program was then coded [17] following the steps in the Supplement I. The
resultant outputs showed difference in statistical nature and suggested to
replace the MC method to the GUM one as soon as possible for this case.",2010-12-13T05:14:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2631v2,gum disease

From Univariate to Multivariate Uncertainty Calculation,Michael P. Krystek,"The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) mainly deals
with measurement models having only a single output quantity. However, in many
cases more than one output quantity is required, where all of them are related
to a common set of input quantities. In order to evaluate the measurement
uncertainties associated with estimated expectations of these output

Gum 48d: an evolved HII region with ongoing star formation,"J. L. Karr, P Manoj, N Ohashi","High mass star formation and the evolution of HII regions have a substantial
impact on the morphology and star formation history of molecular clouds. The
HII region Gum 48d, located in the Centaurus Arm at a distance of 3.5 kpc, is
an old, well evolved HII region whose ionizing stars have moved off the main
sequence. As such, it represents a phase in the evolution of HII regions that
is less well studied than the earlier, more energetic, main sequence phase. In
this paper we use multi-wavelength archive data from a variety of sources to
perform a detailed study of this interesting region. Morphologically, Gum 48d
displays a ring-like faint HII region associated with diffuse emission from the
associated PDR, and is formed from part of a large, massive molecular cloud
complex. There is extensive ongoing star formation in the region, at scales
ranging from low to high mass, which is consistent with triggered star
formation scenarios. We investigate the dynamical history and evolution of this
region, and conclude that the original HII region was once larger and more
energetic than the faint region currently seen. The proposed history of this
molecular cloud complex is one of multiple, linked generations of star
formation, over a period of 10 Myr. Gum 48d differs significantly in morphology
and star formation that the other HII regions in the molecular cloud; these
differences are likely the result of the advanced age of the region, and its
different evolutionary status.",2009-03-05T09:03:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0934v1,gum disease
"About the probability distribution of a quantity with given mean and
  variance","Stefano Olivares, Matteo G. A. Paris","Supplement 1 to GUM (GUM-S1) recommends the use of maximum entropy principle
(MaxEnt) in determining the probability distribution of a quantity having
specified properties, e.g., specified central moments. When we only know the
mean value and the variance of a variable, GUM-S1 prescribes a Gaussian
probability distribution for that variable. When further information is
available, in the form of a finite interval in which the variable is known to
lie, we indicate how the distribution for the variable in this case can be
obtained. A Gaussian distribution should only be used in this case when the
standard deviation is small compared to the range of variation (the length of
the interval). In general, when the interval is finite, the parameters of the
distribution should be evaluated numerically, as suggested by I. Lira,
Metrologia, 46 L27 (2009). Here we note that the knowledge of the range of
variation is equivalent to a bias of the distribution toward a flat
distribution in that range, and the principle of minimum Kullback entropy (mKE)
should be used in the derivation of the probability distribution rather than
the MaxEnt, thus leading to an exponential distribution with non Gaussian
features. Furthermore, up to evaluating the distribution negentropy, we
quantify the deviation of mKE distributions from MaxEnt ones and, thus, we
rigorously justify the use of GUM-S1 recommendation also if we have further
information on the range of variation of a quantity, namely, provided that its
standard uncertainty is sufficiently small compared to the range.",2012-03-13T20:05:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2934v1,gum disease
An Implicit Parametric Morphable Dental Model,"Congyi Zhang, Mohamed Elgharib, Gereon Fox, Min Gu, Christian Theobalt, Wenping Wang","3D Morphable models of the human body capture variations among subjects and
are useful in reconstruction and editing applications. Current dental models
use an explicit mesh scene representation and model only the teeth, ignoring
the gum. In this work, we present the first parametric 3D morphable dental
model for both teeth and gum. Our model uses an implicit scene representation
and is learned from rigidly aligned scans. It is based on a component-wise
representation for each tooth and the gum, together with a learnable latent
code for each of such components. It also learns a template shape thus enabling
several applications such as segmentation, interpolation, and tooth
replacement. Our reconstruction quality is on par with the most advanced global
implicit representations while enabling novel applications. Project page:

"Unifying the Scope of Bridging Anaphora Types in English: Bridging
  Annotations in ARRAU and GUM","Lauren Levine, Amir Zeldes","Comparing bridging annotations across coreference resources is difficult,
largely due to a lack of standardization across definitions and annotation

annotated in the GUM, GENTLE and ARRAU corpora. Examining these cases, we find
that there is a large difference in types of phenomena annotated as bridging.
Beyond theoretical results, we release a harmonized, subcategorized version of

"Is the Gum Nebula an Important Interstellar Scattering Disk of
  Background Pulsars?","Rui Wang, Zhen Yan, Zhiqiang Shen, KeJia Lee, Yajun Wu, Rongbing Zhao, Zhipeng Huang, Xiaowei Wang, Jie Liu","The Gum Nebula is a faint supernova remnant extending about 40 degrees across
the southern sky, potentially affecting tens of background pulsars. Though the
view that the Gum Nebula acts as a potential scattering screen for background
pulsars has been recurrently mentioned over the past five decades, it has not
been directly confirmed. We chose the strong background pulsar PSR~B0740$-$28
as a probe and monitored its diffractive interstellar scintillation (DISS) at
2.25~$\&$~8.60~GHz simultaneously for about two years using the Shanghai Tian
Ma Radio Telescope (TMRT). DISS was detected at both frequencies and quantified
by two-dimensional autocorrelation analysis. We calculated their scattering
spectral index $\alpha$ and found that 9/21 of the observations followed the
theoretical predictions, while 4/21 of them clearly showed $\alpha < 4$. This
finding provides strong support for anomalous scattering along the pulsar line
of sight, due to the large frequency lever arm and the simultaneous features of
our dual-frequency observations. In comparison to the 2.25~GHz observations,
scintillation arcs were observed in 10/21 of the secondary spectrum plots for
8.60~GHz observations. Consequently, the highest frequency record for pulsar
scintillation arc detection was updated to 8.60~GHz. Our fitting results were
the most direct evidence for the view that the Gum Nebula acts as the
scattering screen for background pulsars, because both the distance
($245^{+69}_{-72}$~pc) and transverse speed ($22.4^{+4.1}_{-4.2}$~km/s) of the
scintillation screen are comparable with related parameters of the Gum Nebula.
Our findings indicated that anisotropic scattering provides a superior
explanation for the annual modulation of scintillation arcs than isotropic
scattering. Additionally, the orientation of its long axis was also fitted.",2024-10-11T08:47:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08628v1,gum disease
"Tuning the shear and extensional rheology of semi-flexible
  polyelectrolyte solutions","H. Moon, S. Yamani, G. H. McKinley, J. Lee","Semi-flexible polyelectrolytes are a group of biopolymers with a wide range
of applications from drag reducing agents in turbulent flows to thickening
agents in food and cosmetics. In this study, we investigate the rheology of
aqueous solutions of xanthan gum as a canonical semi-flexible polyelectrolyte
in steady shear and transient extensional flows via torsional rheometry and
dripping-onto-substrate (DoS), respectively. The high molecular weight of the
xanthan gum and the numerous charged groups on the side branches attached to
the backbone allow the shear and extensional rheology of the xanthan gum
solutions to be tuned over a wide range by changing the ionic strength of the
solvent. In steady shear flow, increasing the xanthan gum concentration
increases both the zero shear viscosity and the extent of shear-thinning of the
solution. Conversely, increasing the ionic strength of the solvent by addition
of sodium chloride (NaCl) decreases both the zero shear viscosity and the level
of shear-thinning. In transient extensional flow, increasing the xanthan gum
concentration changes the dynamics of the capillary thinning from an inelastic
power-law (IP) response to an elastocapillary (EC) balance, from which an
extensional relaxation time can be measured based on the rate of filament
thinning. Increasing the NaCl concentration decreases the extensional
relaxation time and the transient extensional viscosity of the viscoelastic
solution. Based on the dynamics of capillary thinning observed in the DoS
experiments, we provide a relationship for the smallest extensional relaxation
time that can be measured using DoS. We suggest that the change in the dynamics
of capillary thinning from an IP response to an EC response can be used as an
easy and robust experimental method for identifying the rheologically effective
overlap concentration of a semi-flexible polyelectrolyte solution, i.e., the
critical concentration at which polymer molecules start to interact with each
other to produce a viscoelastic strain-stiffening response (often perceived as
""stringiness"") in transient extensional flows such as those involved in
dripping, dispensing and filling operations.",2024-10-19T15:13:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15132v1,gum disease
Non-linear regression models for behavioral and neural data analysis,"Vincent Adam, Alexandre Hyafil","Regression models are popular tools in empirical sciences to infer the
influence of a set of variables onto a dependent variable given an experimental
dataset. In neuroscience and cognitive psychology, Generalized Linear Models
(GLMs) -including linear regression, logistic regression, and Poisson GLM- is
the regression model of choice to study the factors that drive participant's
choices, reaction times and neural activations. These methods are however
limited as they only capture linear contributions of each regressors. Here, we
introduce an extension of GLMs called Generalized Unrestricted Models (GUMs),
which allows to infer a much richer set of contributions of the regressors to
the dependent variable, including possible interactions between the regressors.
In a GUM, each regressor is passed through a linear or nonlinear function, and
the contribution of the different resulting transformed regressors can be
summed or multiplied to generate a predictor for the dependent variable. We
propose a Bayesian treatment of these models in which we endow functions with
Gaussian Process priors, and we present two methods to compute a posterior over
the functions given a dataset: the Laplace method and a sparse variational
approach, which scales better for large dataset. For each method, we assess the
quality of the model estimation and we detail how the hyperparameters (defining
for example the expected smoothness of the function) can be fitted. Finally, we
illustrate the power of the method on a behavioral dataset where subjects
reported the average perceived orientation of a series of gratings. The method
allows to recover the mapping of the grating angle onto perceptual evidence for
each subject, as well as the impact of the grating based on its position.
Overall, GUMs provides a very rich and flexible framework to run nonlinear
regression analysis in neuroscience, psychology, and beyond.",2020-02-03T18:00:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00920v1,gum disease
Young Stars near Cometary Globule CG 30 in the Tumultuous Gum Nebula,"Alexandra Yep, Russel J. White","We have conducted a high-dispersion ($R \sim$ 34,000) optical spectroscopic
study of 10 young stars near the cometary gloule CG 30 in the Gum Nebula, a
diffuse H \textsc{ii} region home to at least 32 cometary globules. All 10
spectroscopically observed stars at the nebula's northern edge are of low mass
(spectral types M4.5 - K5), have broad H$\alpha$ emission, and show spectral
veiling. Eight of the 10 are classical T Tauri stars. We spectroscopically
measure the photospheric properties of CG 30 IRS 4 inside CG 30. Though
embedded, CG 30 IRS 4 is T Tauri-like, with relatively slow projected rotation
and moderate veiling. Undepleted Li absorptions, strong H$\alpha$ emissions,
and positions well above the main sequence on an HR diagram suggest the 10
stars are $\lesssim$1 Myr old. Using our measurements, previous spectroscopy,
and previous photometry of 11 other young stars in the area, we determine
stellar, kinematic, and accretion properties of a total of 21 young stars.
Shared radial velocities, proper motions, distances, and ages suggest 14 of the

\textit{Gaia} DR2 distances to 6 of these stars, we derive a distance of

Answer Generation through Unified Memories over Multiple Passages,"Makoto Nakatsuji, Sohei Okui","Machine reading comprehension methods that generate answers by referring to
multiple passages for a question have gained much attention in AI and NLP
communities. The current methods, however, do not investigate the relationships
among multiple passages in the answer generation process, even though topics
correlated among the passages may be answer candidates. Our method, called
neural answer Generation through Unified Memories over Multiple Passages
(GUM-MP), solves this problem as follows. First, it determines which tokens in
the passages are matched to the question. In particular, it investigates
matches between tokens in positive passages, which are assigned to the
question, and those in negative passages, which are not related to the
question. Next, it determines which tokens in the passage are matched to other
passages assigned to the same question and at the same time it investigates the
topics in which they are matched. Finally, it encodes the token sequences with
the above two matching results into unified memories in the passage encoders
and learns the answer sequence by using an encoder-decoder with a
multiple-pointer-generator mechanism. As a result, GUM-MP can generate answers
by pointing to important tokens present across passages. Evaluations indicate
that GUM-MP generates much more accurate results than the current models do.",2020-04-22T11:46:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13829v1,gum disease
"Holocrine Secretion and Kino Flow in Angiosperms: Their Role and
  Physiological Advantages in Plant Defence Mechanisms",Paulo Cabrita,"Kinos are plant exudates, rich in polyphenols, produced by several
angiosperms in reaction to damage. They flow out of kino veins,
schizolysigenous ducts composing an anatomically distinct continuous system of
tangentially anastomosing lacunae produced by the vascular cambium, which
encircle the plant. Kino is secreted holocrinously into the vein lumen by a
cambiform epithelium lined by suberized cells that separate kino veins from the
surrounding axial parenchyma. A model describing kino flow in eucalypts is
presented to investigate how vein distribution and structure, as well as kino
holocrine loading, crystallization, and viscosity affect flow. Considering
viscosity, vein anatomy, and a time-dependent holocrine loading of kino, the
unsteady Stokes equation was applied. Qualitatively, kino flow is similar to
resin flow. There is an increase in flow towards the vein open end, and both
pressure and flow depend on vein dimensions, kino properties and holocrine
loading. However, kino veins present a much smaller specific resistance to flow
compared to resin ducts. Also, unlike resin loading in conifers, holocrine kino
loading is not pressure-driven. The pressure and pressure gradient required to
drive an equally fast flow are smaller than what is observed on the resin ducts
of conifers. These results agree with previous observations on some angiosperms
and suggest that holocrinous gum flow may have lower metabolic energy costs;
thus presenting physiological advantages and possibly constituting an
evolutionary step of angiosperms in using internal secretory systems in plant
defence mechanisms compared to resin flow in conifers. Understanding of how
these physiological and morphological parameters affect kino flow might be
useful for selecting species and developing more sustainable and economically
viable methods of tapping gum and gum resin in angiosperms.",2019-02-20T13:08:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09308v2,gum disease
Collision of Two Stellar Associations in the Nearby Gum Nebula,"Alexandra C. Yep, Russel J. White","Based on Gaia DR2 data and new CHIRON radial velocities, we have discovered
that two nearby stellar associations UPK 535 (318.08 $\pm$ 0.29 pc,

$45^{+55}_{-20}$ Myr, 297 stars) in the Gum Nebula have recently collided. We
project stars' current positions, motions, and measurement uncertainties
backward and forward through time in a 10,000-trial Monte Carlo simulation. On
average, the associations' centres of mass come within 18.89 $\pm$ 0.73 pc of
each other 0.84 $\pm$ 0.03 Myr ago. A mode of 54 $\pm$ 7 close ($<$1 pc)
stellar encounters occur during the collision. We cannot predict specific
star-star close encounters with our current $\sim$7.6 pc distance precision and
21.5-per-cent-complete radial velocity sample. Never the less, we find that two
stars in UPK 535 and two stars in Yep 3 undergo a nonspecific close encounter
in $>$70 per cent of trials and multiple close encounters in $\sim$30 per cent.
On average, the closest approach of any two stars is 0.13 $\pm$ 0.06 pc, or

Discovering young stars in the Gum 31 region with infrared observations,"Henrike Ohlendorf, Thomas Preibisch, Benjamin Gaczkowski, Thorsten Ratzka, Judith Ngoumou, Veronica Roccatagliata, Rebekka Grellmann","Context. The Gum 31 bubble containing the stellar cluster NGC 3324 is a
poorly-studied young region close to the Carina Nebula.
  Aims. We are aiming to characterise the young stellar and protostellar
population in and around Gum 31 and to investigate the star-formation process
in this region.
  Methods. We identify candidate young stellar objects from Spitzer, WISE, and
Herschel data. Combining these, we analyse the spectral energy distributions of
the candidate young stellar objects. With density and temperature maps obtained
from Herschel data and comparisons to a 'collect and collapse' scenario for the
region we are able to further constrain the characteristics of the region as a
whole.
  Results. 661 candidate young stellar objects are found from WISE data, 91
protostar candidates are detected through Herschel observations in a 1.0 deg x
1.1 deg area. Most of these objects are found in small clusters or are well
aligned with the H II bubble. We also identify the sources of Herbig-Haro jets.
The infrared morphology of the region suggests that it is part of the larger
Carina Nebula complex.
  Conclusions. The location of the candidate young stellar objects in the rim
of the H II bubble is suggestive of their being triggered by a 'collect and
collapse' scenario, which agrees well with the observed parameters of the
region. Some candidate young stellar objects are found in the heads of pillars,
which points towards radiative triggering of star formation. Thus, we find
evidence that in the region different mechanisms of triggered star formation
are at work. Correcting the number of candidate young stellar objects for
contamination we find ~ 600 young stellar objects in Gum 31 above our
completeness limit of about 1 M_sol. Extrapolating the intital mass function
down to 0.1 M_sol, we estimate a total population of ~ 5000 young stars for the
region.",2013-01-31T21:00:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0007v1,gum disease
"On the evaluation of uncertainties for state estimation with the Kalman
  filter","S. Eichstädt, N. Makarava, C. Elster","The Kalman filter is an established tool for the analysis of dynamic systems
with normally distributed noise, and it has been successfully applied in
numerous application areas. It provides sequentially calculated estimates of
the system states along with a corresponding covariance matrix. For nonlinear
systems, the extended Kalman filter is often used which is derived from the
Kalman filter by linearization around the current estimate. A key issue in
metrology is the evaluation of the uncertainty associated with the Kalman
filter state estimates. The ""Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in
Measurements"" (GUM) and its supplements serve as the de facto standard for
uncertainty evaluation in metrology. We explore the relationship between the
covariance matrix produced by the Kalman filter and a GUM-compliant uncertainty
analysis. In addition, also the results of a Bayesian analysis are considered.
For the case of linear systems with known system matrices, we show that all
three approaches are compatible. When the system matrices are not precisely
known, however, or when the system is nonlinear, this equivalence breaks down
and different results can be reached then. Though for precisely known nonlinear
systems the result of the extended Kalman filter still corresponds to the
linearized uncertainty propagation of GUM. The extended Kalman filter can
suffer from linearization and convergence errors. These disadvantages can be
avoided to some extent by applying Monte Carlo procedures, and we propose such
a method which is GUM-compliant and can also be applied online during the
estimation. We illustrate all procedures in terms of a two-dimensional dynamic
system and compare the results with those obtained by particle filtering, which
has been proposed for the approximate calculation of a Bayesian solution.
Finally, we give some recommendations based on our findings.",2016-05-04T11:49:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01235v1,gum disease

arcseconds. The HI map revealed complex filamentary structures across a wide
range of velocities. Several ""bubbles"" are clearly identified in the Carina
Nebula Complex, produced by the impact of the massive star clusters located in
this region. An HI absorption profile obtained towards the strong extragalactic
radio source PMN J1032--5917 showed the distribution of the cold component of
the atomic gas along the Galactic disk, with the Sagittarius-Carina and Perseus
spiral arms clearly distinguishable. Preliminary calculations of the optical
depth and spin temperatures of the cold atomic gas show that the HI line is
opaque ($\tau \gtrsim$ 2) at several velocities in the Sagittarius-Carina
spiral arm. The spin temperature is $\sim100$ K in the regions with the highest
optical depth, although this value might be lower for the saturated components.
The atomic mass budget of Gum 31 is $\sim35 \%$ of the total gas mass. HI self
absorption features have molecular counterparts and good spatial correlation
with the regions of cold dust as traced by the infrared maps. We suggest that
in Gum 31 regions of cold temperature and high density are where the atomic to

Guided Upsampling Network for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation,Davide Mazzini,"Semantic segmentation architectures are mainly built upon an encoder-decoder
structure. These models perform subsequent downsampling operations in the
encoder. Since operations on high-resolution activation maps are
computationally expensive, usually the decoder produces output segmentation
maps by upsampling with parameters-free operators like bilinear or
nearest-neighbor. We propose a Neural Network named Guided Upsampling Network
which consists of a multiresolution architecture that jointly exploits
high-resolution and large context information. Then we introduce a new module
named Guided Upsampling Module (GUM) that enriches upsampling operators by
introducing a learnable transformation for semantic maps. It can be plugged
into any existing encoder-decoder architecture with little modifications and
low additional computation cost. We show with quantitative and qualitative
experiments how our network benefits from the use of GUM module. A
comprehensive set of experiments on the publicly available Cityscapes dataset
demonstrates that Guided Upsampling Network can efficiently process
high-resolution images in real-time while attaining state-of-the art

developed independently in distinct communities, they share some similarities
when considered as probabilistic structures. So in this paper we first consider
HMC and RNN as generative models, and we embed both structures in a common
generative unified model (GUM). We next address a comparative study of the
expressivity of these models. To that end we assume that the models are
furthermore linear and Gaussian. The probability distributions produced by
these models are characterized by structured covariance series, and as a
consequence expressivity reduces to comparing sets of structured covariance
series, which enables us to call for stochastic realization theory (SRT). We
finally provide conditions under which a given covariance series can be

"Can we obtain significant success in RST discourse parsing by using
  Large Language Models?","Aru Maekawa, Tsutomu Hirao, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Manabu Okumura","Recently, decoder-only pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with several

"A metrological framework for uncertainty evaluation in machine learning

870 micron continuum observations of the bubble-shaped nebula Gum 31,"N. U. Duronea, J. Vasquez, L. Gómez, C. E. Cappa, V. Firpo, C. H. López-Carballo, M. Rubio","We are presenting here a study of the cold dust in the infrared ring nebula
Gum 31. We aim at deriving the physical properties of the molecular gas and
dust associated with the nebula, and investigating its correlation with the
star formation in the region, that was probably triggered by the expansion of
the ionization front. We use 870 micron data obtained with LABOCA to map the
dust emission. The obtained LABOCA image was compared to archival IR,radio
continuum, and optical images. The 870 micron emission follows the 8 micron
(Spitzer), 250 micron, and 500 micron (Herschel) emission distributions showing
the classical morphology of a spherical shell. We use the 870 micron and 250
micron images to identify 60 dust clumps in the collected layers of molecular
gas using the Gaussclumps algorithm. The clumps have effective deconvolved
radii between 0.16 pc and 1.35 pc, masses between 70 Mo and 2800 Mo, and volume
densities between 1.1x10^3 cm^-3 and 2.04x10^5 cm^-3. The total mass of the
clumps is 37600 Mo. The dust temperature of the clumps is in the range from 21
K to 32 K, while inside the HII region reaches ~ 40 K. The clump mass
distribution is well-fitted by a power law dN/dlog(M/Mo) proportional to
M^(-alpha), with alpha=0.93+/-0.28. The slope differs from those obtained for
the stellar IMF in the solar neighborhood, suggesting that the clumps are not
direct progenitors of single stars/protostars. The mass-radius relationship for
the 41 clumps detected in the 870 microns emission shows that only 37% of them
lie in or above the high-mass star formation threshold, most of them having
candidate YSOs projected inside. A comparison of the dynamical age of the HII

"The mechanism for the exceptionally high tear strength of carbon
  black/Hevea natural rubber vulcanizates","G. Rong, J. Jiang, N. Schmitz, L. Jia, G. R. Hamed","Natural rubber vucanizates containing 0-50 phr of a fine carbon black
(N115,d=27nm) were prepared and tensile strengths of normal (no pre-cut) and
edge pre-cut specimens were determined. Normal tensile strengths of all
vulcanizates were similar. At the relatively slow strain rate experienced
wholesale by normal uncut specimens, all vulcanizates, prior to crack
initiation, strain-crystallized sufficiently to be strong. However, pre-cut
specimens experience increased strain rate at a cut tip. Magnification of the
strain rate increases as cut depth c increases. Fracture in the gum NR and
vulcanizates with up to 14 phr of black occurred by simple forward crack growth
from a cut tip, and all exhibited a critical cut size, above which strength
dropped abruptly. Furthermore, for these lightly filled samples, strength and
critical cut size decreased with increased black content. This indicates less
strain-crystalliation before rupture of pre-cut specimens, when levels of black
are low. This effect is attributerd to rapid straining at a cut tip and
hindering of the chain mobility necessary for crystallization. When black
content was increased to 15 phr, with 1 mm<c<2 mm, about 50% of specimens
retained simple lateral fracture and were weak, but the other 50% developed
deviated cracks (knotty tearing) and were significantly stronger than
corresponding pre-cut gum specimens, especially at large c. High strength with
sufficient black levels are attributed to increased strain-crystallization and
super-blunting (multiple cracks) at a cut tip. These inhibit forward crack
growth. For carbon black to enhance strain-crystallization relative to the gum,
it appears there must be enough of it to form a bound rubber/black network. If
the black concentration is less than this percolation threshold,
strain-crystallization is hindered at a cut tip.",2019-05-23T18:25:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09857v1,gum disease

the gas column density distribution, which appears to be a common feature in

"Dual origin of viscoelasticity in polymer-carbon black hydrogels: a

creative space for the design of functional advanced materials with a broad
range of applications in materials and biological sciences. Here we focus on
aqueous dispersions of hydrophobic colloidal soot particles, namely carbon
black (CB) dispersed with a sodium salt of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a food
additive known as cellulose gum that bears hydrophobic groups, which are liable
to bind physically to CB particles. Varying the relative content of CB
nanoparticles and cellulose gum allows us to explore a rich phase diagram that
includes a gel phase. We investigate this hydrogel using rheometry and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. CB-CMC hydrogels display two radically
different types of mechanical behaviors that are separated by a critical
CMC-to-CB mass ratio $r_c$. For $r<r_c$, i.e., for low CMC concentration, the
gel is electrically conductive and shows a glassy-like viscoelastic spectrum,
pointing to a microstructure composed of a percolated network of CB
nanoparticles decorated by CMC. In contrast, gels with CMC concentration larger
than $r_c$ are non-conductive, indicating that the CB nanoparticles are
dispersed in the cellulose gum matrix as isolated clusters, and act as physical
crosslinkers of the CMC network, hence providing mechanical rigidity to the
composite. Moreover, in the concentration range, $r>r_c$ CB-CMC gels display a
power-law viscoelastic spectrum that depends strongly on the CMC concentration.
These relaxation spectra can be rescaled onto a master curve that exhibits a
power-law scaling in the high-frequency limit, with an exponent that follows
Zimm theory, showing that CMC plays a key role in the gel viscoelastic
properties for $r>r_c$. Our results offer a characterization of CB-CMC

diagrams, complemented with other information, when available, were analysed in
order to infer the properties of the interstellar medium permeating the
observed volumes. On the basis of the overall standard deviation in the
photometric measurements, we estimate that colour excesses and distances are
determined with an accuracy of 0.010 mag and better than 30%, respectively, for
a sample of 520 stars. A comparison with 37 stars in common with the new
Hipparcos catalogue attests to the high quality of the photometric distance
determination. The obtained colour excess versus distance diagrams testify to
the low density volume towards the observed lines-of-sight. Very few stars out
to distances of 1 kpc from the Sun have colour excesses larger than E(b-y) =
0.1 mag. In spite of the low density character of the interstellar medium
towards the Puppis-Vela direction, the obtained reddening as a function of the
distance indicates that two or more interstellar structures are crossed towards
the observed lines-of-sight. One of these structures may be associated with the
very low density wall of the Local Cavity, which has a distance of 100-150 pc
from the Sun. Another structure might be related to the Gum nebula, and if so,
its front face would be located at about 350 pc from the Sun.",2012-05-17T10:49:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3901v1,gum disease
"Chandra X-ray observation of the HII region Gum 31 in the Carina Nebula
  complex","T. Preibisch, M. Mehlhorn, L. Townsley, P. Broos, T. Ratzka","(abridged) We used the Chandra observatory to perform a deep (70 ksec) X-ray
observation of the Gum 31 region and detected 679 X-ray point sources. This
extends and complements the X-ray survey of the central Carina nebula regions
performed in the Chandra Carina Complex Project. Using deep near-infrared
images from our recent VISTA survey of the Carina nebula complex, our Spitzer
point-source catalog, and optical archive data, we identify counterparts for
75% of these X-ray sources. Their spatial distribution shows two major
concentrations, the central cluster NGC 3324 and a partly embedded cluster in
the southern rim of the HII region, but majority of X-ray sources constitute a
rather homogeneously distributed population of young stars. Our color-magnitude
diagram analysis suggests ages of ~1-2 Myr for the two clusters, whereas the
distributed population shows a wider age range up to ~10 Myr. We also identify
previously unknown companions to two of the three O-type members of NGC 3324
and detect diffuse X-ray emission in the region. Our results suggests that the
observed region contains about 4000 young stars in total. The distributed
population is probably part of the widely distributed population of ~ 1-10 Myr
old stars, that was identified in the CCCP area. This implies that the global
stellar configuration of the Carina nebula complex is a very extended stellar
association, in which the (optically prominent) clusters contain only a
minority of the stellar population.",2014-03-27T14:19:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7047v1,gum disease
"Silicone incorporation into an esterquat based fabric softener in
  presence of guar polymers","Evdokia K. Oikonomou, Camille Grandisson, Konstantin Golemanov, Ritu Ahuja, Jean-Franccois Berret","Fabric softeners are widely used to make clothes soft and impart nice smell.
Household conditioners are water-based formulations consisting of quaternary
ammonium surfactants assembled in vesicles. On the other hand, formulations
used for textiles finishing are typically silicone oil emulsions. Here, these
technologies are combined in a novel industrial formulation which contains both
surfactant vesicles and silicone oil. In particular, we insert an
amino-modified silicone oil into a recently developed softener comprising
vesicles of an esterquat and guar polymers. Two strategies based on the use of
esterquat or guar gum as stabilizers for the silicone incorporation in the
fabric softener are proposed. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), cryogenic
transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM), optical and fluorescent microscopy
are applied to study the stability and the insertion of the silicone oil into
the softener. It is shown that silicone oil is stabilized by the surfactant and
the guar gum in nano- or micro-metric droplets. The vesicles structure and
properties are not affected by the silicone oil while the formulation stability
is preserved. These findings suggest that the proposed route for adding
silicone oil into a topical conditioner is a promising route for multipurpose
fabric softener development.",2021-01-18T21:01:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07326v1,gum disease
Modeling the systematic behavior at the micro and nano length scale,Danilo Quagliotti,"The brisk progression of the industrial digital innovation, leading to high
degree of automation and big data transfer in manufacturing technologies,
demands continuous development of appropriate off-line metrology methods to
support processes' quality with a tolerable assessment of the measurement
uncertainty. On the one hand specific-area references propose methods that are
not yet well optimized to the changed background, and on the other,
international general recommendations guide to effective uncertainty
evaluation, but suggesting procedures that are not necessarily proven efficient
at the micro- and nano-dimensional scale. The well-known GUM approach (i.e.
frequentist statistics) was analyzed with the aim to test consistently its
applicability to micro/nano dimensional and surface topography measurements.
The investigation assessed three different clarifying situations, giving rise
to consistent model equations, and to the achievement of the traceability. The
choice of the cases provided a number of influence factors, which are typical
liabilities at the micro and nano-length scale, and that have been related to
the correction of the systematic behavior, viz. the amount of repeated
measurements, the time sequence of the acquired micrographs and the instruments
used. Such approach allowed the successful implementation of the GUM approach
to micro/nano dimensional and topographic measurements, and also the appraisal
of the level of efficacy of the method, its application limits and hints on
possible future developments.",2021-07-27T20:25:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13075v1,gum disease
