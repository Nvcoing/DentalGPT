"American Twitter Users Revealed Social Determinants-related Oral Health
  Disparities amid the COVID-19 Pandemic","Yangxin Fan, Hanjia Lyu, Jin Xiao, Jiebo Luo","Objectives: To assess self-reported population oral health conditions amid
COVID-19 pandemic using user reports on Twitter. Method and Material: We
collected oral health-related tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic from 9,104
Twitter users across 26 states (with sufficient samples) in the United States
between November 12, 2020 and June 14, 2021. We inferred user demographics by
leveraging the visual information from the user profile images. Other
characteristics including income, population density, poverty rate, health
insurance coverage rate, community water fluoridation rate, and relative change
in the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases were acquired or inferred based
on retrieved information from user profiles. We performed logistic regression
to examine whether discussions vary across user characteristics. Results:
Overall, 26.70% of the Twitter users discuss wisdom tooth pain/jaw hurt, 23.86%
tweet about dental service/cavity, 18.97% discuss chipped tooth/tooth break,
16.23% talk about dental pain, and the rest are about tooth decay/gum bleeding.
Women and younger adults (19-29) are more likely to talk about oral health
problems. Health insurance coverage rate is the most significant predictor in
logistic regression for topic prediction. Conclusion: Tweets inform social
disparities in oral health during the pandemic. For instance, people from
counties at a higher risk of COVID-19 talk more about tooth decay/gum bleeding
and chipped tooth/tooth break. Older adults, who are vulnerable to COVID-19,
are more likely to discuss dental pain. Topics of interest vary across user
characteristics. Through the lens of social media, our findings may provide
insights for oral health practitioners and policy makers.",2021-09-16T01:10:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07652v2,tooth decay
"ViSTooth: A Visualization Framework for Tooth Segmentation on Panoramic
  Radiograph","Shenji Zhu, Miaoxin Hu, Tianya Pan, Yue Hong, Bin Li, Zhiguang Zhou, Ting Xu","Tooth segmentation is a key step for computer aided diagnosis of dental
diseases. Numerous machine learning models have been employed for tooth
segmentation on dental panoramic radiograph. However, it is a difficult task to
achieve accurate tooth segmentation due to complex tooth shapes, diverse tooth
categories and incomplete sample set for machine learning. In this paper, we
propose ViSTooth, a visualization framework for tooth segmentation on dental
panoramic radiograph. First, we employ Mask R-CNN to conduct preliminary tooth
segmentation, and a set of domain metrics are proposed to estimate the accuracy
of the segmented teeth, including tooth shape, tooth position and tooth angle.
Then, we represent the teeth with high-dimensional vectors and visualize their
distribution in a low-dimensional space, in which experts can easily observe
those teeth with specific metrics. Further, we expand the sample set with the
expert-specified teeth and train the tooth segmentation model iteratively.
Finally, we conduct case study and expert study to demonstrate the
effectiveness and usability of our ViSTooth, in aiding experts to implement
accurate tooth segmentation guided by expert knowledge.",2024-05-14T13:10:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08573v1,tooth decay
"Electrical Switching of Tristate Antiferromagnetic Néel Order in
  $α$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ Epitaxial Films","Yang Cheng, Sisheng Yu, Menglin Zhu, Jinwoo Hwang, Fengyuan Yang","The ability to manipulate antiferromagnetic (AF) moments is a key requirement
for the emerging field of antiferromagnetic spintronics. Electrical switching
of bi-state AF moments has been demonstrated in metallic AFs, CuMnAs and
Mn$_2$Au. Recently, current-induced ""saw-tooth"" shaped Hall resistance was
reported in Pt/NiO bilayers, while its mechanism is under debate. Here, we
report the first demonstration of convincing, non-decaying, step-like
electrical switching of tri-state N\'eel order in Pt/$\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$
bilayers. Our experimental data, together with Monte-Carlo simulations, reveal
the clear mechanism of the switching behavior of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ N\'eel
order among three stable states. We also show that the observed ""saw-tooth""
Hall resistance is due to an artifact of Pt, not AF switching, while the
signature of AF switching is step-like Hall signals. This demonstration of
electrical control of magnetic moments in AF insulator (AFI) films will greatly
expand the scope of AF spintronics by leveraging the large family of AFIs.",2019-06-11T16:52:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04694v2,tooth decay
Dense Representative Tooth Landmark/axis Detection Network on 3D Model,"Guangshun Wei, Zhiming Cui, Jie Zhu, Lei Yang, Yuanfeng Zhou, Pradeep Singh, Min Gu, Wenping Wang","Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is increasingly used for digital
orthodontics, but one of the challenges is to automatically and accurately
detect tooth landmarks and axes. This is partly because of sophisticated
geometric definitions of them, and partly due to large variations among
individual tooth and across different types of tooth. As such, we propose a
deep learning approach with a labeled dataset by professional dentists to the
tooth landmark/axis detection on tooth model that are crucial for orthodontic
treatments. Our method can extract not only tooth landmarks in the form of
point (e.g. cusps), but also axes that measure the tooth angulation and
inclination. The proposed network takes as input a 3D tooth model and predicts
various types of the tooth landmarks and axes. Specifically, we encode the
landmarks and axes as dense fields defined on the surface of the tooth model.
This design choice and a set of added components make the proposed network more
suitable for extracting sparse landmarks from a given 3D tooth model. Extensive
evaluation of the proposed method was conducted on a set of dental models
prepared by experienced dentists. Results show that our method can produce
tooth landmarks with high accuracy. Our method was examined and justified via
comparison with the state-of-the-art methods as well as the ablation studies.",2021-11-08T00:42:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04212v2,tooth decay
DArch: Dental Arch Prior-assisted 3D Tooth Instance Segmentation,"Liangdong Qiu, Chongjie Ye, Pei Chen, Yunbi Liu, Xiaoguang Han, Shuguang Cui","Automatic tooth instance segmentation on 3D dental models is a fundamental
task for computer-aided orthodontic treatments. Existing learning-based methods
rely heavily on expensive point-wise annotations. To alleviate this problem, we
are the first to explore a low-cost annotation way for 3D tooth instance
segmentation, i.e., labeling all tooth centroids and only a few teeth for each
dental model. Regarding the challenge when only weak annotation is provided, we
present a dental arch prior-assisted 3D tooth segmentation method, namely
DArch. Our DArch consists of two stages, including tooth centroid detection and
tooth instance segmentation. Accurately detecting the tooth centroids can help
locate the individual tooth, thus benefiting the segmentation. Thus, our DArch
proposes to leverage the dental arch prior to assist the detection.
Specifically, we firstly propose a coarse-to-fine method to estimate the dental
arch, in which the dental arch is initially generated by Bezier curve
regression, and then a graph-based convolutional network (GCN) is trained to
refine it. With the estimated dental arch, we then propose a novel Arch-aware
Point Sampling (APS) method to assist the tooth centroid proposal generation.
Meantime, a segmentor is independently trained using a patch-based training
strategy, aiming to segment a tooth instance from a 3D patch centered at the
tooth centroid. Experimental results on $4,773$ dental models have shown our
DArch can accurately segment each tooth of a dental model, and its performance
is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.",2022-04-25T18:30:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11911v1,tooth decay
"Mandibular Teeth Movement Variations in Tipping Scenario: A Finite
  Element Study on Several Patients","Torkan Gholamalizadeh, Sune Darkner, Paolo Maria Cattaneo, Peter Søndergaard, Kenny Erleben","Previous studies on computational modeling of tooth movement in orthodontic
treatments are limited to a single model and fail in generalizing the
simulation results to other patients. To this end, we consider multiple
patients and focus on tooth movement variations under the identical load and
boundary conditions both for intra- and inter-patient analyses. We introduce a
novel computational analysis tool based on finite element models (FEMs)
addressing how to assess initial tooth displacement in the mandibular dentition
across different patients for uncontrolled tipping scenarios with different
load magnitudes applied to the mandibular dentition. This is done by modeling
the movement of each patient's tooth as a nonlinear function of both load and
tooth size. As the size of tooth can affect the resulting tooth displacement, a
combination of two clinical biomarkers obtained from the tooth anatomy, i.e.,
crown height and root volume, is considered to make the proposed model
generalizable to different patients and teeth.",2020-10-11T14:51:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05258v1,tooth decay
Boundary feature fusion network for tooth image segmentation,"Dongping Zhang, Zheng Li, Fangao Zeng, Yutong Wei","Tooth segmentation is a critical technology in the field of medical image
segmentation, with applications ranging from orthodontic treatment to human
body identification and dental pathology assessment. Despite the development of
numerous tooth image segmentation models by researchers, a common shortcoming
is the failure to account for the challenges of blurred tooth boundaries.
Dental diagnostics require precise delineation of tooth boundaries. This paper
introduces an innovative tooth segmentation network that integrates boundary
information to address the issue of indistinct boundaries between teeth and
adjacent tissues. This network's core is its boundary feature extraction
module, which is designed to extract detailed boundary information from
high-level features. Concurrently, the feature cross-fusion module merges
detailed boundary and global semantic information in a synergistic way,
allowing for stepwise layer transfer of feature information. This method
results in precise tooth segmentation. In the most recent STS Data Challenge,
our methodology was rigorously tested and received a commendable overall score
of 0.91. When compared to other existing approaches, this score demonstrates
our method's significant superiority in segmenting tooth boundaries.",2024-09-06T02:12:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03982v1,tooth decay
"Angular momentum removal by neutron and $γ$-ray emissions during
  fission fragment decays","I. Stetcu, A. E. Lovell, P. Talou, T. Kawano, S. Marin, S. A. Pozzi, A. Bulgac","We investigate the angular momentum removal from fission fragments (FFs)
through neutron and $\gamma$-ray emission, where we find that about half the
neutrons are emitted with angular momenta $\ge 1.5\hbar$ and that the change in
angular momentum after the emission of neutrons and statistical $\gamma$ rays
is significant, contradicting usual assumptions. Per fission event, in our
simulations, the neutron and statistical $\gamma$-ray emissions change the spin
of the fragment by 3.5 -- 5~$\hbar$, with a large standard deviation comparable
to the average value. Such wide angular momentum removal distributions can hide
any underlying correlations in the fission fragment initial spin values. Within
our model, we reproduce data on spin measurements from discrete transitions
after neutron emissions, especially in the case of light FFs. The agreement
further improves for the heavy fragments if one removes from the analysis the
events that would produce isomeric states. Finally, we show that while in our
model the initial FF spins do not follow a saw-tooth like behavior observed in
recent measurements, the average FF spin computed after neutron and statistical
$\gamma$ emissions exhibits a shape that resembles a saw tooth. This suggests
that the average FF spin measured after statistical emissions is not
necessarily connected with the scission mechanism as previously implied.",2021-08-09T20:54:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04347v2,tooth decay
Tooth-shaped plasmonic waveguide filters with nanometeric sizes,"Xianshi Lin, Xuguang Huang","A novel nanometeric plasmonic filter in a tooth-shaped Metal-Insulator-Metal

tooth-shaped filter has a wavelength filtering characteristic and an
ultra-compact size in the length of a few hundred nanometers, compared to
grating-like SPPs filters. Both analytic and simulation results show that the
wavelength of the trough of the transmission has linear and nonlinear
relationships with the tooth depth and the tooth width, respectively. The

Multiscale modelling couples patches of nonlinear wave-like simulations,"Meng Cao, A. J. Roberts","The multiscale gap-tooth scheme is built from given microscale simulations of
complicated physical processes to empower macroscale simulations. By coupling
small patches of simulations over unsimulated physical gaps, large savings in
computational time are possible. So far the gap-tooth scheme has been developed
for dissipative systems, but wave systems are also of great interest. This
article develops the gap-tooth scheme to the case of nonlinear microscale
simulations of wave-like systems. Classic macroscale interpolation provides a
generic coupling between patches that achieves arbitrarily high order
consistency between the multiscale scheme and the underlying microscale
dynamics. Eigen-analysis indicates that the resultant gap-tooth scheme empowers
feasible computation of large scale simulations of wave-like dynamics with
complicated underlying physics. As an pilot study, we implement numerical
simulations of dam-breaking waves by the gap-tooth scheme. Comparison between a
gap-tooth simulation, a microscale simulation over the whole domain, and some

Multiscale modelling couples patches of two-layer thin fluid flow,"Meng Cao, A. J. Roberts","The multiscale gap-tooth scheme uses a given microscale simulator of
complicated physical processes to enable macroscale simulations by computing
only only small sparse patches. This article develops the gap-tooth scheme to
the case of nonlinear microscale simulations of thin fluid flow. The microscale
simulator is derived by artificially assuming the fluid film flow having two
artificial layers but no distinguishing physical feature. Centre manifold
theory assures that there exists a slow manifold in the two-layer fluid film
flow. Eigenvalue analysis confirms the stability of the microscale simulator.
This article uses the gap-tooth scheme to simulate the two-layer fluid film
flow. Coupling conditions are developed by approximating the values at the
edges of patches by neighbouring macroscale values. Numerical eigenvalue
analysis suggests that the gap-tooth scheme with the developed two-layer
microscale simulator empowers feasible computation of large scale simulations
of fluid film flows. We also implement numerical simulations of the fluid film

3D Tooth Mesh Segmentation with Simplified Mesh Cell Representation,"Ananya Jana, Hrebesh Molly Subhash, Dimitris N. Metaxas","Manual tooth segmentation of 3D tooth meshes is tedious and there is
variations among dentists. %Manual tooth annotation of 3D tooth meshes is a
tedious task. Several deep learning based methods have been proposed to perform
automatic tooth mesh segmentation. Many of the proposed tooth mesh segmentation
algorithms summarize the mesh cell as - the cell center or barycenter, the
normal at barycenter, the cell vertices and the normals at the cell vertices.
Summarizing of the mesh cell/triangle in this manner imposes an implicit
structural constraint and makes it difficult to work with multiple resolutions
which is done in many point cloud based deep learning algorithms. We propose a
novel segmentation method which utilizes only the barycenter and the normal at
the barycenter information of the mesh cell and yet achieves competitive
performance. We are the first to demonstrate that it is possible to relax the
implicit structural constraint and yet achieve superior segmentation

  Segmentation on Cone Beam Computed Tomography Images","Weiwei Cui, Yaqi Wang, Qianni Zhang, Huiyu Zhou, Dan Song, Xingyong Zuo, Gangyong Jia, Liaoyuan Zeng","3D tooth segmentation is a prerequisite for computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. However, segmenting all tooth regions manually is subjective and
time-consuming. Recently, deep learning-based segmentation methods produce
convincing results and reduce manual annotation efforts, but it requires a

tooth data available for the 3D segmentation study. In this paper, we establish
a fully annotated cone beam computed tomography dataset CTooth with tooth gold
standard. This dataset contains 22 volumes (7363 slices) with fine tooth labels
annotated by experienced radiographic interpreters. To ensure a relative even
data sampling distribution, data variance is included in the CTooth including
missing teeth and dental restoration. Several state-of-the-art segmentation

"ToothInpaintor: Tooth Inpainting from Partial 3D Dental Model and 2D
  Panoramic Image","Yuezhi Yang, Zhiming Cui, Changjian Li, Wenping Wang","In orthodontic treatment, a full tooth model consisting of both the crown and
root is indispensable in making the treatment plan. However, acquiring tooth
root information to obtain the full tooth model from CBCT images is sometimes
restricted due to the massive radiation of CBCT scanning. Thus, reconstructing
the full tooth shape from the ready-to-use input, e.g., the partial intra-oral
scan and the 2D panoramic image, is an applicable and valuable solution. In
this paper, we propose a neural network, called ToothInpaintor, that takes as
input a partial 3D dental model and a 2D panoramic image and reconstructs the
full tooth model with high-quality root(s). Technically, we utilize the
implicit representation for both the 3D and 2D inputs, and learn a latent space
of the full tooth shapes. At test time, given an input, we successfully project
it to the learned latent space via neural optimization to obtain the full tooth
model conditioned on the input. To help find the robust projection, a novel
adversarial learning module is exploited in our pipeline. We extensively
evaluate our method on a dataset collected from real-world clinics. The

  Segmentation and Classification in Tooth-marked Tongue Diagnosis","Shunkai Shi, Yuqi Wang, Qihui Ye, Yanran Wang, Yiming Zhu, Muhammad Hassan, Aikaterini Melliou, Dongmei Yu","In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the tooth marks on the tongue, stemming from
prolonged dental pressure, serve as a crucial indicator for assessing qi (yang)

of tooth-marked tongue solely relies on experience. Nonetheless, the diversity

accuracy and consistency. To address these problems, herein we propose a
multi-task joint learning model named Ammonia-Net. This model employs a
convolutional neural network-based architecture, specifically designed for
multi-class segmentation and classification of tongue images. Ammonia-Net
performs semantic segmentation of tongue images to identify tongue and tooth

into the desired number of classes: healthy tongue, light tongue, moderate
tongue, and severe tongue. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to
apply the semantic segmentation results of tooth marks for tooth-marked tongue
classification. To train Ammonia-Net, we collect 856 tongue images from 856

"Automatic Tooth Arrangement with Joint Features of Point and Mesh
  Representations via Diffusion Probabilistic Models","Changsong Lei, Mengfei Xia, Shaofeng Wang, Yaqian Liang, Ran Yi, Yuhui Wen, Yongjin Liu","Tooth arrangement is a crucial step in orthodontics treatment, in which
aligning teeth could improve overall well-being, enhance facial aesthetics, and
boost self-confidence. To improve the efficiency of tooth arrangement and
minimize errors associated with unreasonable designs by inexperienced
practitioners, some deep learning-based tooth arrangement methods have been
proposed. Currently, most existing approaches employ MLPs to model the
nonlinear relationship between tooth features and transformation matrices to
achieve tooth arrangement automatically. However, the limited datasets (which
to our knowledge, have not been made public) collected from clinical practice
constrain the applicability of existing methods, making them inadequate for
addressing diverse malocclusion issues. To address this challenge, we propose a
general tooth arrangement neural network based on the diffusion probabilistic
model. Conditioned on the features extracted from the dental model, the
diffusion probabilistic model can learn the distribution of teeth
transformation matrices from malocclusion to normal occlusion by gradually
denoising from a random variable, thus more adeptly managing real orthodontic
data. To take full advantage of effective features, we exploit both mesh and
point cloud representations by designing different encoding networks to extract
the tooth (local) and jaw (global) features, respectively. In addition to
traditional metrics ADD, PA-ADD, CSA, and ME_{rot}, we propose a new evaluation
metric based on dental arch curves to judge whether the generated teeth meet
the individual normal occlusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method achieves state-of-the-art tooth alignment results and

"Tooth Instance Segmentation from Cone-Beam CT Images through Point-based
  Detection and Gaussian Disentanglement","Jusang Lee, Minyoung Chung, Minkyung Lee, Yeong-Gil Shin","Individual tooth segmentation and identification from cone-beam computed
tomography images are preoperative prerequisites for orthodontic treatments.
Instance segmentation methods using convolutional neural networks have
demonstrated ground-breaking results on individual tooth segmentation tasks,
and are used in various medical imaging applications. While point-based
detection networks achieve superior results on dental images, it is still a
challenging task to distinguish adjacent teeth because of their similar
topologies and proximate nature. In this study, we propose a point-based tooth
localization network that effectively disentangles each individual tooth based
on a Gaussian disentanglement objective function. The proposed network first
performs heatmap regression accompanied by box regression for all the
anatomical teeth. A novel Gaussian disentanglement penalty is employed by
minimizing the sum of the pixel-wise multiplication of the heatmaps for all
adjacent teeth pairs. Subsequently, individual tooth segmentation is performed
by converting a pixel-wise labeling task to a distance map regression task to
minimize false positives in adjacent regions of the teeth. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
by increasing the average precision of detection by 9.1%, which results in a
high performance in terms of individual tooth segmentation. The primary
significance of the proposed method is two-fold: 1) the introduction of a
point-based tooth detection framework that does not require additional
classification and 2) the design of a novel loss function that effectively
separates Gaussian distributions based on heatmap responses in the point-based

diagnostic method that can reflect an individual's health status. Traditional

Then, we implement an end-to-end weakly supervised object detection method. We
utilize Vision Transformer (ViT) to process tongue images in patches and employ
multiple instance loss to identify tooth-marked regions with only image-level

and visualization experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in pinpointing
these regions. This automated approach enhances the objectivity and accuracy of

"Pose-Aware Instance Segmentation Framework from Cone Beam CT Images for
  Tooth Segmentation","Minyoung Chung, Minkyung Lee, Jioh Hong, Sanguk Park, Jusang Lee, Jingyu Lee, Jeongjin Lee, Yeong-Gil Shin","Individual tooth segmentation from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)
images is an essential prerequisite for an anatomical understanding of
orthodontic structures in several applications, such as tooth reformation
planning and implant guide simulations. However, the presence of severe metal
artifacts in CBCT images hinders the accurate segmentation of each individual
tooth. In this study, we propose a neural network for pixel-wise labeling to
exploit an instance segmentation framework that is robust to metal artifacts.
Our method comprises of three steps: 1) image cropping and realignment by pose
regressions, 2) metal-robust individual tooth detection, and 3) segmentation.
We first extract the alignment information of the patient by pose regression
neural networks to attain a volume-of-interest (VOI) region and realign the
input image, which reduces the inter-overlapping area between tooth bounding
boxes. Then, individual tooth regions are localized within a VOI realigned
image using a convolutional detector. We improved the accuracy of the detector
by employing non-maximum suppression and multiclass classification metrics in
the region proposal network. Finally, we apply a convolutional neural network
(CNN) to perform individual tooth segmentation by converting the pixel-wise
labeling task to a distance regression task. Metal-intensive image augmentation
is also employed for a robust segmentation of metal artifacts. The result shows
that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially
for teeth with metal artifacts. The primary significance of the proposed method
is two-fold: 1) an introduction of pose-aware VOI realignment followed by a
robust tooth detection and 2) a metal-robust CNN framework for accurate tooth
segmentation.",2020-02-06T07:57:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02143v1,tooth decay
"A new giant species of placented worm and the mechanism by which
  onychophorans weave their nets (Onychophora: Peripatidae)","Bernal Morera-Brenes, Julián Monge-Nájera","Onychophorans, or velvet worms, are poorly known and rare animals. Here we
report the discovery of a new species that is also the largest onychophoran
found so far, a 22cm long female from the Caribbean coastal forest of Costa
Rica. Specimens were examined with Scanning Electron Microscopy; Peripatus
solorzanoi sp. nov., is diagnosed as follows: primary papillae convex and
conical with rounded bases, with more than 18 scale ranks. Apical section
large, spherical, with a basal diameter of at least 20 ranks. Apical piece with
6-7 scale ranks. Outer blade 1 principal tooth, 1 accessory tooth, 1 vestigial
accessory tooth (formula: 1/1/1); inner blade 1 principal tooth, 1 accessory
tooth, 1 rudimentary accessory tooth, 9 to 10 denticles (formula: 1/1/1/9-10).
Accessory tooth blunt in both blades. Four pads in the fourth and fifth
oncopods; 4th. pad arched. The previously unknown mechanism by which
onychophorans weave their adhesive is simple: muscular action produces a
swinging movement of the adhesive-spelling organs; as a result, the streams
cross in mid air, weaving the net. Like all onychophorans, P. solorzanoi is a
rare species: active protection of the habitat of the largest onychophoran ever

  intraoral impressions with stitching error correction via individual tooth
  segmentation and identification","Tae Jun Jang, Hye Sun Yun, Chang Min Hyun, Jong-Eun Kim, Sang-Hwy Lee, Jin Keun Seo","We present a fully automated method of integrating intraoral scan (IOS) and
dental cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) images into one image by
complementing each image's weaknesses. Dental CBCT alone may not be able to
delineate precise details of the tooth surface due to limited image resolution
and various CBCT artifacts, including metal-induced artifacts. IOS is very
accurate for the scanning of narrow areas, but it produces cumulative stitching
errors during full-arch scanning. The proposed method is intended not only to
compensate the low-quality of CBCT-derived tooth surfaces with IOS, but also to
correct the cumulative stitching errors of IOS across the entire dental arch.
Moreover, the integration provide both gingival structure of IOS and tooth
roots of CBCT in one image. The proposed fully automated method consists of
four parts; (i) individual tooth segmentation and identification module for IOS
data (TSIM-IOS); (ii) individual tooth segmentation and identification module
for CBCT data (TSIM-CBCT); (iii) global-to-local tooth registration between IOS

"Automatic Tooth Segmentation from 3D Dental Model using Deep Learning: A
  Quantitative Analysis of what can be learnt from a Single 3D Dental Model","Ananya Jana, Hrebesh Molly Subhash, Dimitris Metaxas","3D tooth segmentation is an important task for digital orthodontics. Several
Deep Learning methods have been proposed for automatic tooth segmentation from
3D dental models or intraoral scans. These methods require annotated 3D
intraoral scans. Manually annotating 3D intraoral scans is a laborious task.
One approach is to devise self-supervision methods to reduce the manual
labeling effort. Compared to other types of point cloud data like scene point
cloud or shape point cloud data, 3D tooth point cloud data has a very regular
structure and a strong shape prior. We look at how much representative
information can be learnt from a single 3D intraoral scan. We evaluate this
quantitatively with the help of ten different methods of which six are generic
point cloud segmentation methods whereas the other four are tooth segmentation
specific methods. Surprisingly, we find that with a single 3D intraoral scan
training, the Dice score can be as high as 0.86 whereas the full training set
gives Dice score of 0.94. We conclude that the segmentation methods can learn a
great deal of information from a single 3D tooth point cloud scan under
suitable conditions e.g. data augmentation. We are the first to quantitatively
evaluate and demonstrate the representation learning capability of Deep
Learning methods from a single 3D intraoral scan. This can enable building
self-supervision methods for tooth segmentation under extreme data limitation

"On the two separate decay time scales of a detonation wave modelled by
  the Burgers equation and their relation to its chaotic dynamics","S. SM. Lau-Chapdelaine, M. I. Radulescu","This study uses a simplified detonation model to investigate the behaviour of
detonations with galloping-like pulsations. The reactive Burgers equation is
used for the hydrodynamic equation, coupled to a pulsed source whereby all the
shocked reactants are simultaneously consumed at fixed time intervals. The
model mimics the short periodic amplifications of the shock front followed by
relatively lengthy decays seen in galloping detonations. Numerical simulations
reveal a saw tooth evolution of the front velocity with a period-averaged
detonation speed equal to the Chapman-Jouguet velocity. The detonation velocity
exhibits two distinct groups of decay time scales, punctuated by reaction
pulses. At each pulse, a rarefaction wave is created at the reaction front's
last position. A characteristic investigation reveals that characteristics
originating from the head of this rarefaction take 1.57 periods to reach and
attenuate the detonation front, while characteristics at the tail take an
additional period. The leading characteristics are amplified twice, by passing
through the reaction fronts of subsequent pulses, before arriving at the shock
front, whilst the trailing characteristics are amplified three times. This
leads to the two distinct groups of time scales seen in the detonation front

morphological and filtering operations, which are applied to the sigmoid output

theoretical analyses and recent experimental demonstrations, a rigorous proof
of the universally optimal configuration for the highest AFC retrieval
efficiency has not been presented. In this paper we present a simple analytical
proof which shows that the optimized square tooth offers the highest retrieval
efficiency among all tooth shapes, under the physical constraint of finite
optical depth of an atomic ensemble. The optimality still holds when the
non-zero background absorption and the finite optical linewidth of atoms are

each of the encoders and decoders is replaced by a group Transformer, which
significantly reduces the computational cost of traditional Transformer

role in a variety of dental applications. However, segmentation performance of
previous methods are error-prone in complicated tooth-tooth or tooth-gingiva

"Differentiable Collision-Supervised Tooth Arrangement Network with a
  Decoupling Perspective","Zhihui He, Chengyuan Wang, Shidong Yang, Li Chen, Yanheng Zhou, Shuo Wang","Tooth arrangement is an essential step in the digital orthodontic planning
process. Existing learning-based methods use hidden teeth features to directly
regress teeth motions, which couples target pose perception and motion
regression. It could lead to poor perceptions of three-dimensional
transformation. They also ignore the possible overlaps or gaps between teeth of
predicted dentition, which is generally unacceptable. Therefore, we propose
DTAN, a differentiable collision-supervised tooth arrangement network,
decoupling predicting tasks and feature modeling. DTAN decouples the tooth
arrangement task by first predicting the hidden features of the final teeth
poses and then using them to assist in regressing the motions between the
beginning and target teeth. To learn the hidden features better, DTAN also
decouples the teeth-hidden features into geometric and positional features,
which are further supervised by feature consistency constraints. Furthermore,
we propose a novel differentiable collision loss function for point cloud data
to constrain the related gestures between teeth, which can be easily extended
to other 3D point cloud tasks. We propose an arch-width guided tooth

All-Optical Noise Quenching of An Integrated Frequency Comb,"Gregory Moille, Pradyoth Shandilya, Jordan Stone, Curtis Menyuk, Kartik Srinivasan","Integrated frequency combs promise transformation of lab-based metrology into
disruptive real-world applications. These microcombs are, however, sensitive to
stochastic thermal fluctuations of the integrated cavity refractive index, with
its impact becoming more significant as the cavity size becomes smaller. This
tradeoff between microcomb noise performance and footprint stands as a
prominent obstacle to realizing applications beyond a controlled lab
environment. Here, we demonstrate that small footprint and low noise become
compatible through the all-optical Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) method.
Our study unveils that the phase-locking nature of the synchronization between
the cavity soliton and the injected reference pump laser enables the microcomb
to no longer be limited by internal noise sources. Instead, the microcomb noise
is mostly limited by external sources, namely, the frequency noise of the two
pumps that doubly pin the microcomb. First, we theoretically and experimentally
show that the individual comb tooth linewidths of an octave-spanning microcomb
remain within the same order-of-magnitude as the pump lasers, contrary to the
single-pumped case that exhibits a more than two order-of-magnitude increase
from the pump to the comb edge. Second, we theoretically show that intrinsic
noise sources such as thermorefractive noise in KIS are quenched at the cavity
decay rate, greatly decreasing its impact. Experimentally, we show that even

junctions characterized by $E_J$ and $\alpha E_J$ Josephson energies,
accordingly. In the frustrated regime the low energy quantum dynamics of a
single cell is determined by anticlockwise or clockwise flowing persistent
currents (vortex/antivortex). The direct embedding of $\pi$-Josephson junctions
in a transmission line allows to establish a short/long-range interaction

which acquaints the segmentation model with generated degraded images during
training. ToothSegNet merges the information of high and low quality images
from the designed degradation simulation module using channel-wise cross fusion
to reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder, and also refines the
shape of tooth prediction through a structural constraint loss. Experimental
results suggest that ToothSegNet produces more precise segmentation and
outperforms the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation methods.",2023-07-05T01:41:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01979v1,tooth decay
"A Multi-Stage Framework for 3D Individual Tooth Segmentation in Dental
  CBCT","Chunshi Wang, Bin Zhao, Shuxue Ding","Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a common way of diagnosing dental
related diseases. Accurate segmentation of 3D tooth is of importance for the
treatment. Although deep learning based methods have achieved convincing
results in medical image processing, they need a large of annotated data for
network training, making it very time-consuming in data collection and
annotation. Besides, domain shift widely existing in the distribution of data
acquired by different devices impacts severely the model generalization. To
resolve the problem, we propose a multi-stage framework for 3D tooth
segmentation in dental CBCT, which achieves the third place in the
""Semi-supervised Teeth Segmentation"" 3D (STS-3D) challenge. The experiments on
validation set compared with other semi-supervised segmentation methods further
indicate the validity of our approach.",2024-07-15T04:23:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10433v1,tooth decay
"GeoT: Geometry-guided Instance-dependent Transition Matrix for
  Semi-supervised Tooth Point Cloud Segmentation","Weihao Yu, Xiaoqing Guo, Chenxin Li, Yifan Liu, Yixuan Yuan","Achieving meticulous segmentation of tooth point clouds from intra-oral scans
stands as an indispensable prerequisite for various orthodontic applications.
Given the labor-intensive nature of dental annotation, a significant amount of
data remains unlabeled, driving increasing interest in semi-supervised
approaches. One primary challenge of existing semi-supervised medical
segmentation methods lies in noisy pseudo labels generated for unlabeled data.
To address this challenge, we propose GeoT, the first framework that employs
instance-dependent transition matrix (IDTM) to explicitly model noise in pseudo
labels for semi-supervised dental segmentation. Specifically, to handle the
extensive solution space of IDTM arising from tens of thousands of dental
points, we introduce tooth geometric priors through two key components:
point-level geometric regularization (PLGR) to enhance consistency between
point adjacency relationships in 3D and IDTM spaces, and class-level geometric
smoothing (CLGS) to leverage the fixed spatial distribution of tooth categories
for optimal IDTM estimation. Extensive experiments performed on the public
Teeth3DS dataset and private dataset demonstrate that our method can make full
utilization of unlabeled data to facilitate segmentation, achieving performance
comparable to fully supervised methods with only $20\%$ of the labeled data.",2025-03-21T09:43:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16976v1,tooth decay
