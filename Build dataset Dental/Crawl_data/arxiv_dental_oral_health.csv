"OralCam: Enabling Self-Examination and Awareness of Oral Health Using a
  Smartphone Camera","Yuan Liang, Hsuan-Wei Fan, Zhujun Fang, Leiying Miao, Wen Li, Xuan Zhang, Weibin Sun, Kun Wang, Lei He, Xiang Anthony Chen","Due to a lack of medical resources or oral health awareness, oral diseases
are often left unexamined and untreated, affecting a large population
worldwide. With the advent of low-cost, sensor-equipped smartphones, mobile
apps offer a promising possibility for promoting oral health. However, to the
best of our knowledge, no mobile health (mHealth) solutions can directly
support a user to self-examine their oral health condition. This paper presents
OralCam, the first interactive app that enables end-users' self-examination of
five common oral conditions (diseases or early disease signals) by taking
smartphone photos of one's oral cavity. OralCam allows a user to annotate
additional information (e.g. living habits, pain, and bleeding) to augment the
input image, and presents the output hierarchically, probabilistically and with
visual explanations to help a laymen user understand examination results.
Developed on our in-house dataset that consists of 3,182 oral photos annotated
by dental experts, our deep learning based framework achieved an average
detection sensitivity of 0.787 over five conditions with high localization
accuracy. In a week-long in-the-wild user study (N=18), most participants had
no trouble using OralCam and interpreting the examination results. Two expert
interviews further validate the feasibility of OralCam for promoting users'
awareness of oral health.",2020-01-16T02:54:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05621v2,oral health
"American Twitter Users Revealed Social Determinants-related Oral Health
  Disparities amid the COVID-19 Pandemic","Yangxin Fan, Hanjia Lyu, Jin Xiao, Jiebo Luo","Objectives: To assess self-reported population oral health conditions amid
COVID-19 pandemic using user reports on Twitter. Method and Material: We
collected oral health-related tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic from 9,104
Twitter users across 26 states (with sufficient samples) in the United States
between November 12, 2020 and June 14, 2021. We inferred user demographics by
leveraging the visual information from the user profile images. Other
characteristics including income, population density, poverty rate, health
insurance coverage rate, community water fluoridation rate, and relative change
in the number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases were acquired or inferred based
on retrieved information from user profiles. We performed logistic regression
to examine whether discussions vary across user characteristics. Results:
Overall, 26.70% of the Twitter users discuss wisdom tooth pain/jaw hurt, 23.86%
tweet about dental service/cavity, 18.97% discuss chipped tooth/tooth break,
16.23% talk about dental pain, and the rest are about tooth decay/gum bleeding.
Women and younger adults (19-29) are more likely to talk about oral health
problems. Health insurance coverage rate is the most significant predictor in
logistic regression for topic prediction. Conclusion: Tweets inform social
disparities in oral health during the pandemic. For instance, people from
counties at a higher risk of COVID-19 talk more about tooth decay/gum bleeding
and chipped tooth/tooth break. Older adults, who are vulnerable to COVID-19,
are more likely to discuss dental pain. Topics of interest vary across user
characteristics. Through the lens of social media, our findings may provide
insights for oral health practitioners and policy makers.",2021-09-16T01:10:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07652v2,oral health
"Quantifying a qualitative framework of patients perceptions, attitudes
  and behavior relevant to oral health related quality of life","Angelo Passalacqua, Stephen Dunne, Tim J Newton, Nairn HF Wilson, Ana Nora Donaldson","In a qualitative study, Gregory, Gibson and Robinson proposed a framework of
items grouped in seven dimensions reflecting oral health related perceptions,
attitudes and behavior to encompass what is relevant when patients assess their
own oral health related quality of life (OHRQOL). The aim of this study is to
quantify the dimensions of Gregory relevance framework and confirm, or
otherwise, the influence on the change in the OHIP-14, an instrument widely
used to measure OHRQOL. The study was observational and longitudinal with the
OHIP-14 measured before a tooth extraction, and two and four weeks thereafter.
Statistical methods of analysis consisted of generalised estimating equations.
Responsiveness (or sensitivity to change) of the OHIP-14 was established in our
patient population. The dimensions of Gregory relevance framework featured
significantly in the models. Patients trust in dental products, perception of
own oral health as normal in relation to the average person, preference for
natural teeth, character bias in judgement and control by adherence to dentists
instructions, were all found to be significant factors in the longitudinal
change of the OHIP-14. Borderline significance was found in terms of dental
anxiety and symptoms. Perceptions, behaviour and attitudes, rather than
socio-demographic characteristics or oral health related knowledge, influence
change in OHRQOL. Trusting that the dentist values the patient as a person and
the importance the patient gives to having good oral health, are not found
significant, yet adhering to dentists advice has a beneficial effect on OHRQOL.",2017-12-12T16:13:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04784v1,oral health
"Enhancing Automated Decision Support across Medical and Oral Health
  Domains with Semantic Web Technologies","Tejal Shah, Fethi Rabhi, Pradeep Ray, Kerry Taylor","Research has shown that the general health and oral health of an individual
are closely related. Accordingly, current practice of isolating the information
base of medical and oral health domains can be dangerous and detrimental to the
health of the individual. However, technical issues such as heterogeneous data
collection and storage formats, limited sharing of patient information and lack
of decision support over the shared information are the principal reasons for
the current state of affairs. To address these issues, the following research
investigates the development and application of a cross-domain ontology and

Mobile Application for Oral Disease Detection using Federated Learning,"Shankara Narayanan V, Sneha Varsha M, Syed Ashfaq Ahmed, Guruprakash J","The mouth, often regarded as a window to the internal state of the body,
plays an important role in reflecting one's overall health. Poor oral hygiene
has far-reaching consequences, contributing to severe conditions like heart
disease, cancer, and diabetes, while inadequate care leads to discomfort, pain,
and costly treatments. Federated Learning (FL) for object detection can be
utilized for this use case due to the sensitivity of the oral image data of the
patients. FL ensures data privacy by storing the images used for object
detection on the local device and trains the model on the edge. The updated
weights are federated to a central server where all the collected weights are
updated via The Federated Averaging algorithm. Finally, we have developed a
mobile app named OralH which provides user-friendly solutions, allowing people
to conduct self-assessments through mouth scans and providing quick oral health
insights. Upon detection of the issues, the application alerts the user about
potential oral health concerns or diseases and provides details about dental
clinics in the user's locality. Designed as a Progressive Web Application
(PWA), the platform ensures ubiquitous access, catering to users across devices
for a seamless experience. The application aims to provide state-of-the-art
segmentation and detection techniques, leveraging the YOLOv8 object detection
model to identify oral hygiene issues and diseases. This study deals with the
benefits of leveraging FL in healthcare with promising real-world results.",2023-10-27T16:41:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12044v1,oral health
"Dental Severity Assessment through Few-shot Learning and SBERT
  Fine-tuning",Mohammad Dehghani,"Dental diseases have a significant impact on a considerable portion of the
population, leading to various health issues that can detrimentally affect
individuals' overall well-being. The integration of automated systems in oral
healthcare has become increasingly crucial. Machine learning approaches offer a
viable solution to address challenges such as diagnostic difficulties,
inefficiencies, and errors in oral disease diagnosis. These methods prove
particularly useful when physicians struggle to predict or diagnose diseases at
their early stages. In this study, thirteen different machine learning, deep
learning, and large language models were employed to determine the severity
level of oral health issues based on radiologists' reports. The results
revealed that the Few-shot learning with SBERT and Multi-Layer Perceptron model
outperformed all other models across various experiments, achieving an
impressive accuracy of 94.1% as the best result. Consequently, this model
exhibits promise as a reliable tool for evaluating the severity of oral
diseases, enabling patients to receive more effective treatment and aiding
healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding resource
allocation and the management of high-risk patients.",2024-02-24T08:02:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15755v2,oral health
The oral tolerance as a complex network phenomenon,"Pedro J. Miranda, Murilo Delgobo, Giovanni M. Favero, Kátia S. Paludo, Murilo S. Baptista, Sandro E. de S. Pinto","The phenomenon of oral tolerance refers to a local and systemic state of
tolerance, induced in the gut associated lymphoid tissues, after its exposure
to innocuous antigens, such as food proteins. While recent findings shed light
in the cellular and molecular basis of oral tolerance, the network of
interactions between the components mediating oral tolerance has not been
investigated yet. Our work brings a complex systems theory approach, aiming to
identify the contribution of each element in an oral tolerance network. We also
propose a model that allows dynamical plus topological quantifying which must
encompass functional responses as the local host involved on the oral
tolerance. To keep track of reality of our model, we test knockout (KO) of
immunological components (i. e. silencing a vertex) and see how it diverges
when the system is topologically health. The results from these simulated KO's
are then compared to real molecular knock-outs. To infer from these processing
we apply a new implementation of a random walk algorithm for directed graphs,
which ultimately generate statistical quantities provided by the dynamical
behaviour of the simulated KO's. It was observed that the a specifics KO caused
the greatest impact on network standard flux. In a brief analysis, the results
obtained correspond to biological data. Our model addresses both topological
proprieties and dynamical relations. The construction of a qualitative dynamic
model for oral tolerance could reflect empirical observations, through the
standard flux results and relative error based on individual knockout.",2013-11-13T18:16:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3237v1,oral health
"Automated Process Incorporating Machine Learning Segmentation and
  Correlation of Oral Diseases with Systemic Health","Gregory Yauney, Aman Rana, Lawrence C. Wong, Perikumar Javia, Ali Muftu, Pratik Shah","Imaging fluorescent disease biomarkers in tissues and skin is a non-invasive
method to screen for health conditions. We report an automated process that
combines intraoral fluorescent porphyrin biomarker imaging, clinical
examinations and machine learning for correlation of systemic health conditions
with periodontal disease. 1215 intraoral fluorescent images, from 284
consenting adults aged 18-90, were analyzed using a machine learning classifier
that can segment periodontal inflammation. The classifier achieved an AUC of
0.677 with precision and recall of 0.271 and 0.429, respectively, indicating a
learned association between disease signatures in collected images. Periodontal
diseases were more prevalent among males (p=0.0012) and older subjects
(p=0.0224) in the screened population. Physicians independently examined the
collected images, assigning localized modified gingival indices (MGIs). MGIs
and periodontal disease were then cross-correlated with responses to a medical
history questionnaire, blood pressure and body mass index measurements, and
optic nerve, tympanic membrane, neurological, and cardiac rhythm imaging
examinations. Gingivitis and early periodontal disease were associated with
subjects diagnosed with optic nerve abnormalities (p <0.0001) in their retinal
scans. We also report significant co-occurrences of periodontal disease in
subjects reporting swollen joints (p=0.0422) and a family history of eye
disease (p=0.0337). These results indicate cross-correlation of poor
periodontal health with systemic health outcomes and stress the importance of
oral health screenings at the primary care level. Our screening process and
analysis method, using images and machine learning, can be generalized for
automated diagnoses and systemic health screenings for other diseases.",2018-10-25T00:42:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10664v1,oral health
"Reward Design For An Online Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Supporting
  Oral Self-Care","Anna L. Trella, Kelly W. Zhang, Inbal Nahum-Shani, Vivek Shetty, Finale Doshi-Velez, Susan A. Murphy","Dental disease is one of the most common chronic diseases despite being
largely preventable. However, professional advice on optimal oral hygiene
practices is often forgotten or abandoned by patients. Therefore patients may
benefit from timely and personalized encouragement to engage in oral self-care
behaviors. In this paper, we develop an online reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm for use in optimizing the delivery of mobile-based prompts to
encourage oral hygiene behaviors. One of the main challenges in developing such
an algorithm is ensuring that the algorithm considers the impact of the current
action on the effectiveness of future actions (i.e., delayed effects),
especially when the algorithm has been made simple in order to run stably and
autonomously in a constrained, real-world setting (i.e., highly noisy, sparse
data). We address this challenge by designing a quality reward which maximizes
the desired health outcome (i.e., high-quality brushing) while minimizing user
burden. We also highlight a procedure for optimizing the hyperparameters of the
reward by building a simulation environment test bed and evaluating candidates
using the test bed. The RL algorithm discussed in this paper will be deployed
in Oralytics, an oral self-care app that provides behavioral strategies to
boost patient engagement in oral hygiene practices.",2022-08-15T18:47:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07406v3,oral health
"A Novel Approach using CapsNet and Deep Belief Network for Detection and
  Identification of Oral Leukopenia","Hirthik Mathesh GV, Kavin Chakravarthy M, Sentil Pandi S","Oral cancer constitutes a significant global health concern, resulting in
277,484 fatalities in 2023, with the highest prevalence observed in low- and
middle-income nations. Facilitating automation in the detection of possibly
malignant and malignant lesions in the oral cavity could result in
cost-effective and early disease diagnosis. Establishing an extensive
repository of meticulously annotated oral lesions is essential. In this
research photos are being collected from global clinical experts, who have been
equipped with an annotation tool to generate comprehensive labelling. This
research presents a novel approach for integrating bounding box annotations
from various doctors. Additionally, Deep Belief Network combined with CAPSNET
is employed to develop automated systems that extracted intricate patterns to
address this challenging problem. This study evaluated two deep learning-based
computer vision methodologies for the automated detection and classification of
oral lesions to facilitate the early detection of oral cancer: image
classification utilizing CAPSNET. Image classification attained an F1 score of
94.23% for detecting photos with lesions 93.46% for identifying images
necessitating referral. Object detection attained an F1 score of 89.34% for
identifying lesions for referral. Subsequent performances are documented about

"TIFTI: A Framework for Extracting Drug Intervals from Longitudinal
  Clinic Notes","Monica Agrawal, Griffin Adams, Nathan Nussbaum, Benjamin Birnbaum","Oral drugs are becoming increasingly common in oncology care. In contrast to
intravenous chemotherapy, which is administered in the clinic and carefully
tracked via structure electronic health records (EHRs), oral drug treatment is
self-administered and therefore not tracked as well. Often, the details of oral
cancer treatment occur only in unstructured clinic notes. Extracting this
information is critical to understanding a patient's treatment history. Yet,
this a challenging task because treatment intervals must be inferred
longitudinally from both explicit mentions in the text as well as from document
timestamps. In this work, we present TIFTI (Temporally Integrated Framework for
Treatment Intervals), a robust framework for extracting oral drug treatment
intervals from a patient's unstructured notes. TIFTI leverages distinct sources
of temporal information by breaking the problem down into two separate
subtasks: document-level sequence labeling and date extraction. On a labeled
dataset of metastatic renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) patients, it exactly matched
the labeled start date in 46% of the examples (86% of the examples within 30
days), and it exactly matched the labeled end date in 52% of the examples (78%
of the examples within 30 days). Without retraining, the model achieved a
similar level of performance on a labeled dataset of advanced non-small-cell

"Modelling disease progression with multi-level electronic health records
  data and informative observation times: an application to treating iron
  deficiency anaemia in primary care of the UK","Li Su, Yafeng Cheng, Dora I. A. Pereira, Jonathan J. Powell","Modelling disease progression of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) following oral
iron supplement prescriptions is a prerequisite for evaluating the
cost-effectiveness of oral iron supplements. Electronic health records (EHRs)
from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) provide rich longitudinal
data on IDA disease progression in patients registered with 663 General
Practitioner (GP) practices in the UK, but they also create challenges in
statistical analyses. First, the CPRD data are clustered at multi-levels (i.e.,
GP practices and patients), but their large volume makes it computationally
difficult to implement estimation of standard random effects models for
multi-level data. Second, observation times in the CPRD data are irregular and
could be informative about the disease progression. For example, shorter/longer
gap times between GP visits could be associated with deteriorating/improving
IDA. Existing methods to address informative observation times are mostly based
on complex joint models, which adds more computational burden. To tackle these
challenges, we develop a computationally efficient approach to modelling
disease progression with EHRs data while accounting for variability at
multi-level clusters and informative observation times. We apply the proposed
method to the CPRD data to investigate IDA improvement and treatment

Replicable Bandits for Digital Health Interventions,"Kelly W. Zhang, Nowell Closser, Anna L. Trella, Susan A. Murphy","Adaptive treatment assignment algorithms, such as bandit and reinforcement
learning algorithms, are increasingly used in digital health intervention
clinical trials. Causal inference and related data analyses are critical for
evaluating digital health interventions, deciding how to refine the
intervention, and deciding whether to roll-out the intervention more broadly.
However the replicability of these analyses has received relatively little
attention. This work investigates the replicability of statistical analyses
from trials deploying adaptive treatment assignment algorithms. We demonstrate
that many standard statistical estimators can be inconsistent and fail to be
replicable across repetitions of the clinical trial, even as the sample size
grows large. We show that this non-replicability is intimately related to
properties of the adaptive algorithm itself. We introduce a formal definition
of a ""replicable bandit algorithm"" and prove that under such algorithms, a wide
variety of common statistical analyses are guaranteed to be consistent. We
present both theoretical results and simulation studies based on a mobile
health oral health self-care intervention. Our findings underscore the
importance of designing adaptive algorithms with replicability in mind,
especially for settings like digital health where deployment decisions rely
heavily on replicated evidence. We conclude by discussing open questions on the

"A reference-invariant health disparity index based on Rényi
  divergence",Makram Talih,"One of four overarching goals of Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) is to achieve
health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups. In
health disparity indices (HDIs) such as the mean log deviation (MLD) and Theil
index (TI), disparities are relative to the population average, whereas in the
index of disparity (IDisp) the reference is the group with the least adverse
health outcome. Although the latter may be preferable, identification of a
reference group can be affected by statistical reliability. To address this
issue, we propose a new HDI, the R\'{e}nyi index (RI), which is
reference-invariant. When standardized, the RI extends the Atkinson index,
where a disparity aversion parameter can incorporate societal values associated
with health equity. In addition, both the MLD and TI are limiting cases of the
RI. Also, a symmetrized R\'{e}nyi index (SRI) can be constructed, resulting in
a symmetric measure in the two distributions whose relative entropy is being
evaluated. We discuss alternative symmetric and reference-invariant HDIs
derived from the generalized entropy (GE) class and the Bregman divergence, and
argue that the SRI is more robust than its GE-based counterpart to small
changes in the distribution of the adverse health outcome. We evaluate the
design-based standard errors and bootstrapped sampling distributions for the
SRI, and illustrate the proposed methodology using data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) on the 2001-04 prevalence of
moderate or severe periodontitis among adults aged 45-74, which track Oral

  Methods: A dataset of 13,887 bitewings from the HUNT4 Oral Health Study were
annotated individually by six different experts, and used to train three
different object detection deep-learning architectures: RetinaNet (ResNet50),
YOLOv5 (M size), and EfficientDet (D0 and D1 sizes). A consensus dataset of 197

five-fold cross validation scheme was used to evaluate the performance of the
AI models.
  Results: he trained models show an increase in average precision and
F1-score, and decrease of false negative rate, with respect to the dental
clinicians. When compared against the dental clinicians, the YOLOv5 model shows
the largest improvement, reporting 0.647 mean average precision, 0.548 mean

primary health care patients. In studies with a mismatch between an AI normal
report and the original radiologist report, a consensus read by two
board-certified radiologists was conducted to make the final diagnosis.
  Results: After the exclusion of cases not meeting the study criteria, 9579

  Conclusions: AI was able to correctly rule out 36.4% of chest X-rays with no
significant findings of primary health care patients, with a minimal number of
false negatives that would lead to effectively no compromise on patient safety.

"Figurative-cum-Commonsense Knowledge Infusion for Multimodal Mental
  Health Meme Classification","Abdullah Mazhar, Zuhair hasan shaik, Aseem Srivastava, Polly Ruhnke, Lavanya Vaddavalli, Sri Keshav Katragadda, Shweta Yadav, Md Shad Akhtar","The expression of mental health symptoms through non-traditional means, such
as memes, has gained remarkable attention over the past few years, with users
often highlighting their mental health struggles through figurative intricacies
within memes. While humans rely on commonsense knowledge to interpret these
complex expressions, current Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) struggle to
capture these figurative aspects inherent in memes. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel dataset, AxiOM, derived from the GAD anxiety questionnaire,
which categorizes memes into six fine-grained anxiety symptoms. Next, we
propose a commonsense and domain-enriched framework, M3H, to enhance MLMs'
ability to interpret figurative language and commonsense knowledge. The
overarching goal remains to first understand and then classify the mental
health symptoms expressed in memes. We benchmark M3H against 6 competitive
baselines (with 20 variations), demonstrating improvements in both quantitative
and qualitative metrics, including a detailed human evaluation. We observe a
clear improvement of 4.20% and 4.66% on weighted-F1 metric. To assess the
generalizability, we perform extensive experiments on a public dataset,
RESTORE, for depressive symptom identification, presenting an extensive
ablation study that highlights the contribution of each module in both
datasets. Our findings reveal limitations in existing models and the advantage
of employing commonsense to enhance figurative understanding.",2025-01-25T20:36:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15321v1,oral health
"Let it shine: Autofluorescence of Papanicolaou-stain improves AI-based
  cytological oral cancer detection","Wenyi Lian, Joakim Lindblad, Christina Runow Stark, Jan-Michaél Hirsch, Nataša Sladoje","Oral cancer is a global health challenge. It is treatable if detected early,
but it is often fatal in late stages. There is a shift from the invasive and
time-consuming tissue sampling and histological examination, toward
non-invasive brush biopsies and cytological examination. Reliable
computer-assisted methods are essential for cost-effective and accurate
cytological analysis, but the lack of detailed cell-level annotations impairs
model effectiveness. This study aims to improve AI-based oral cancer detection
using multimodal imaging and deep fusion. We combine brightfield and
fluorescence whole slide microscopy imaging to analyze Papanicolaou-stained
liquid-based cytology slides of brush biopsies collected from both healthy and
cancer patients. Due to limited cytological annotations, we utilize a weakly
supervised deep learning approach using only patient-level labels. We evaluate
various multimodal fusion strategies, including early, late, and three recent
intermediate fusion methods. Our results show: (i) fluorescence imaging of
Papanicolaou-stained samples provides substantial diagnostic information; (ii)
multimodal fusion enhances classification and cancer detection accuracy over
single-modality methods. Intermediate fusion is the leading method among the
studied approaches. Specifically, the Co-Attention Fusion Network (CAFNet)
model excels with an F1 score of 83.34% and accuracy of 91.79%, surpassing
human performance on the task. Additional tests highlight the need for precise
image registration to optimize multimodal analysis benefits. This study
advances cytopathology by combining deep learning and multimodal imaging to
enhance early, non-invasive detection of oral cancer, improving diagnostic
accuracy and streamlining clinical workflows. The developed pipeline is also
applicable in other cytological settings. Our codes and dataset are available

Understanding Client Reactions in Online Mental Health Counseling,"Anqi Li, Lizhi Ma, Yaling Mei, Hongliang He, Shuai Zhang, Huachuan Qiu, Zhenzhong Lan","Communication success relies heavily on reading participants' reactions. Such
feedback is especially important for mental health counselors, who must
carefully consider the client's progress and adjust their approach accordingly.
However, previous NLP research on counseling has mainly focused on studying
counselors' intervention strategies rather than their clients' reactions to the
intervention. This work aims to fill this gap by developing a theoretically
grounded annotation framework that encompasses counselors' strategies and
client reaction behaviors. The framework has been tested against a large-scale,
high-quality text-based counseling dataset we collected over the past two years

  Prediction","Jun Wu, Xuesong Ye, Chengjie Mou, Weinan Dai","Monitoring the health status of patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is
a critical aspect of providing superior care and treatment. The availability of

highly accurate predictions. Despite the emergence of advanced Natural Language
Processing (NLP) algorithms for clinical note analysis, the complex textual

challenges. Coarse embedding approaches without domain-specific refinement have
limited the accuracy of these algorithms. To address this issue, we propose
FINEEHR, a system that utilizes two representation learning techniques, namely
metric learning and fine-tuning, to refine clinical note embeddings, while
leveraging the intrinsic correlations among different health statuses and note
categories. We evaluate the performance of FINEEHR using two metrics, namely
Area Under the Curve (AUC) and AUC-PR, on a real-world MIMIC III dataset. Our
experimental results demonstrate that both refinement approaches improve
prediction accuracy, and their combination yields the best results. Moreover,

Large-Scale Study of Temporal Shift in Health Insurance Claims,"Christina X Ji, Ahmed M Alaa, David Sontag","Most machine learning models for predicting clinical outcomes are developed
using historical data. Yet, even if these models are deployed in the near
future, dataset shift over time may result in less than ideal performance. To
capture this phenomenon, we consider a task--that is, an outcome to be
predicted at a particular time point--to be non-stationary if a historical
model is no longer optimal for predicting that outcome. We build an algorithm
to test for temporal shift either at the population level or within a
discovered sub-population. Then, we construct a meta-algorithm to perform a
retrospective scan for temporal shift on a large collection of tasks. Our
algorithms enable us to perform the first comprehensive evaluation of temporal

"Integrating complex selection rules into the latent overlapping group
  Lasso for constructing coherent prediction models","Guanbo Wang, Sylvie Perreault, Robert W. Platt, Rui Wang, Marc Dorais, Mireille E. Schnitzer","The construction of coherent prediction models holds great importance in
medical research as such models enable health researchers to gain deeper
insights into disease epidemiology and clinicians to identify patients at
higher risk of adverse outcomes. One commonly employed approach to developing
prediction models is variable selection through penalized regression
techniques. Integrating natural variable structures into this process not only
enhances model interpretability but can also %increase the likelihood of
recovering the true underlying model and boost prediction accuracy. However, a
challenge lies in determining how to effectively integrate potentially complex
selection dependencies into the penalized regression. In this work, we
demonstrate how to represent selection dependencies mathematically, provide
algorithms for deriving the complete set of potential models, and offer a
structured approach for integrating complex rules into variable selection
through the latent overlapping group Lasso. To illustrate our methodology, we
applied these techniques to construct a coherent prediction model for major

"World Trade Center responders in their own words: Predicting PTSD
  symptom trajectories with AI-based language analyses of interviews","Youngseo Son, Sean A. P. Clouston, Roman Kotov, Johannes C. Eichstaedt, Evelyn J. Bromet, Benjamin J. Luft, H Andrew Schwartz","Background: Oral histories from 9/11 responders to the World Trade Center
(WTC) attacks provide rich narratives about distress and resilience. Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models promise to detect psychopathology in natural language,
but they have been evaluated primarily in non-clinical settings using social
media. This study sought to test the ability of AI-based language assessments
to predict PTSD symptom trajectories among responders. Methods: Participants
were 124 responders whose health was monitored at the Stony Brook WTC Health
and Wellness Program who completed oral history interviews about their initial
WTC experiences. PTSD symptom severity was measured longitudinally using the
PTSD Checklist (PCL) for up to 7 years post-interview. AI-based indicators were
computed for depression, anxiety, neuroticism, and extraversion along with
dictionary-based measures of linguistic and interpersonal style. Linear
regression and multilevel models estimated associations of AI indicators with
concurrent and subsequent PTSD symptom severity (significance adjusted by false
discovery rate). Results: Cross-sectionally, greater depressive language
(beta=0.32; p=0.043) and first-person singular usage (beta=0.31; p=0.044) were
associated with increased symptom severity. Longitudinally, anxious language
predicted future worsening in PCL scores (beta=0.31; p=0.031), whereas
first-person plural usage (beta=-0.37; p=0.007) and longer words usage
(beta=-0.36; p=0.007) predicted improvement. Conclusions: This is the first
study to demonstrate the value of AI in understanding PTSD in a vulnerable

"Bayesian Variable Selection for Multivariate Zero-Inflated Models:
  Application to Microbiome Count Data","Kyu Ha Lee, Brent A. Coull, Anna-Barbara Moscicki, Bruce J. Paster, Jacqueline R. Starr","Microorganisms play critical roles in human health and disease. It is well
known that microbes live in diverse communities in which they interact
synergistically or antagonistically. Thus for estimating microbial associations
with clinical covariates, multivariate statistical models are preferred.
Multivariate models allow one to estimate and exploit complex interdependencies
among multiple taxa, yielding more powerful tests of exposure or treatment
effects than application of taxon-specific univariate analyses. In addition,
the analysis of microbial count data requires special attention because data
commonly exhibit zero inflation. To meet these needs, we developed a Bayesian
variable selection model for multivariate count data with excess zeros that
incorporates information on the covariance structure of the outcomes (counts
for multiple taxa), while estimating associations with the mean levels of these
outcomes. Although there has been a great deal of effort in zero-inflated
models for longitudinal data, little attention has been given to
high-dimensional multivariate zero-inflated data modeled via a general
correlation structure. Through simulation, we compared performance of the
proposed method to that of existing univariate approaches, for both the binary
and count parts of the model. When outcomes were correlated the proposed
variable selection method maintained type I error while boosting the ability to
identify true associations in the binary component of the model. For the count
part of the model, in some scenarios the the univariate method had higher power
than the multivariate approach. This higher power was at a cost of a highly
inflated false discovery rate not observed with the proposed multivariate
method. We applied the approach to oral microbiome data from the Pediatric
HIV/AIDS Cohort Oral Health Study and identified five species (of 44)
associated with HIV infection.",2017-11-01T01:34:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00157v3,oral health

"Targeted Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect in Observational
  Survival Analysis","Jie Zhu, Blanca Gallego","The aim of clinical effectiveness research using repositories of electronic
health records is to identify what health interventions 'work best' in
real-world settings. Since there are several reasons why the net benefit of
intervention may differ across patients, current comparative effectiveness
literature focuses on investigating heterogeneous treatment effect and
predicting whether an individual might benefit from an intervention. The
majority of this literature has concentrated on the estimation of the effect of
treatment on binary outcomes. However, many medical interventions are evaluated
in terms of their effect on future events, which are subject to loss to
follow-up. In this study, we describe a framework for the estimation of
heterogeneous treatment effect in terms of differences in time-to-event
(survival) probabilities. We divide the problem into three phases: (1)
estimation of treatment effect conditioned on unique sets of the covariate
vector; (2) identification of features important for heterogeneity using an
ensemble of non-parametric variable importance methods; and (3) estimation of
treatment effect on the reference classes defined by the previously selected
features, using one-step Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We conducted a
series of simulation studies and found that this method performs well when
either sample size or event rate is high enough and the number of covariates

inaccurate models and the overlook of individual variability. In this paper, we
propose a data-driven CS framework that can learn signal characteristics and
personalized features from any individual recording of physiologic signals to
enhance CS performance with a minimized number of measurements. Such
improvements are accomplished by a co-training approach that optimizes the
sensing matrix and the dictionary towards improved restricted isometry property
and signal sparsity, respectively. Experimental results upon ECG signals show
that the proposed method, at a compression ratio of 10x, successfully reduces
the isometry constant of the trained sensing matrices by 86% against random
matrices and improves the overall reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio by 15dB
over conventional model-driven approaches.",2016-12-15T00:10:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04887v2,oral health
"Comparing Suicide Risk Insights derived from Clinical and Social Media
  data","Rohith K. Thiruvalluru, Manas Gaur, Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan, Amit Sheth, Jyotishman Pathak","Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the US and the 2nd leading
cause of death among teenagers. Clinical and psychosocial factors contribute to
suicide risk (SRFs), although documentation and self-expression of such factors
in EHRs and social networks vary. This study investigates the degree of
variance across EHRs and social networks. We performed subjective analysis of
SRFs, such as self-harm, bullying, impulsivity, family violence/discord, using
>13.8 Million clinical notes on 123,703 patients with mental health conditions.
We clustered clinical notes using semantic embeddings under a set of SRFs.
Likewise, we clustered 2180 suicidal users on r/SuicideWatch (~30,000 posts)
and performed comparative analysis. Top-3 SRFs documented in EHRs were
depressive feelings (24.3%), psychological disorders (21.1%), drug abuse
(18.2%). In r/SuicideWatch, gun-ownership (17.3%), self-harm (14.6%), bullying
(13.2%) were Top-3 SRFs. Mentions of Family violence, racial discrimination,
and other important SRFs contributing to suicide risk were missing from both
platforms.",2020-12-18T05:54:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11393v2,oral health
"Predicting Opioid Use Disorder from Longitudinal Healthcare Data using
  Multi-stream Transformer","Sajjad Fouladvand, Jeffery Talbert, Linda P. Dwoskin, Heather Bush, Amy Lynn Meadows, Lars E. Peterson, Ramakanth Kavuluru, Jin Chen","Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a public health crisis costing the US billions
of dollars annually in healthcare, lost workplace productivity, and crime.
Analyzing longitudinal healthcare data is critical in addressing many
real-world problems in healthcare. Leveraging the real-world longitudinal
healthcare data, we propose a novel multi-stream transformer model called MUPOD
for OUD identification. MUPOD is designed to simultaneously analyze multiple
types of healthcare data streams, such as medications and diagnoses, by
attending to segments within and across these data streams. Our model tested on
the data from 392,492 patients with long-term back pain problems showed
significantly better performance than the traditional models and recently
developed deep learning models.",2021-03-16T01:44:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08800v2,oral health
Fine-grained Hand Gesture Recognition in Multi-viewpoint Hand Hygiene,"Huy Q. Vo, Tuong Do, Vi C. Pham, Duy Nguyen, An T. Duong, Quang D. Tran","This paper contributes a new high-quality dataset for hand gesture
recognition in hand hygiene systems, named ""MFH"". Generally, current datasets
are not focused on: (i) fine-grained actions; and (ii) data mismatch between
different viewpoints, which are available under realistic settings. To address
the aforementioned issues, the MFH dataset is proposed to contain a total of
731147 samples obtained by different camera views in 6 non-overlapping
locations. Additionally, each sample belongs to one of seven steps introduced
by the World Health Organization (WHO). As a minor contribution, inspired by
advances in fine-grained image recognition and distribution adaptation, this
paper recommends using the self-supervised learning method to handle these
preceding problems. The extensive experiments on the benchmarking MFH dataset
show that the introduced method yields competitive performance in both the
Accuracy and the Macro F1-score. The code and the MFH dataset are available at
https://github.com/willogy-team/hand-gesture-recognition-smc2021.",2021-09-07T08:14:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02917v1,oral health
"Extracting Biomedical Factual Knowledge Using Pretrained Language Model
  and Electronic Health Record Context","Zonghai Yao, Yi Cao, Zhichao Yang, Vijeta Deshpande, Hong Yu","Language Models (LMs) have performed well on biomedical natural language
processing applications. In this study, we conducted some experiments to use
prompt methods to extract knowledge from LMs as new knowledge Bases (LMs as
KBs). However, prompting can only be used as a low bound for knowledge
extraction, and perform particularly poorly on biomedical domain KBs. In order
to make LMs as KBs more in line with the actual application scenarios of the
biomedical domain, we specifically add EHR notes as context to the prompt to
improve the low bound in the biomedical domain. We design and validate a series
of experiments for our Dynamic-Context-BioLAMA task. Our experiments show that
the knowledge possessed by those language models can distinguish the correct
knowledge from the noise knowledge in the EHR notes, and such distinguishing
ability can also be used as a new metric to evaluate the amount of knowledge
possessed by the model.",2022-08-26T00:01:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07859v2,oral health
Generating Synthetic Population,"Bhavesh Neekhra, Kshitij Kapoor, Debayan Gupta","In this paper, we provide a method to generate synthetic population at
various administrative levels for a country like India. This synthetic
population is created using machine learning and statistical methods applied to
survey data such as Census of India 2011, IHDS-II, NSS-68th round, GPW etc. The
synthetic population defines individuals in the population with characteristics
such as age, gender, height, weight, home and work location, household
structure, preexisting health conditions, socio-economical status, and
employment. We used the proposed method to generate the synthetic population
for various districts of India. We also compare this synthetic population with
source data using various metrics. The experiment results show that the
synthetic data can realistically simulate the population for various districts
of India.",2022-09-20T19:31:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09961v2,oral health
"Self-Supervised Predictive Coding with Multimodal Fusion for Patient
  Deterioration Prediction in Fine-grained Time Resolution","Kwanhyung Lee, John Won, Heejung Hyun, Sangchul Hahn, Edward Choi, Joohyung Lee","Accurate time prediction of patients' critical events is crucial in urgent
scenarios where timely decision-making is important. Though many studies have
proposed automatic prediction methods using Electronic Health Records (EHR),
their coarse-grained time resolutions limit their practical usage in urgent
environments such as the emergency department (ED) and intensive care unit
(ICU). Therefore, in this study, we propose an hourly prediction method based
on self-supervised predictive coding and multi-modal fusion for two critical
tasks: mortality and vasopressor need prediction. Through extensive
experiments, we prove significant performance gains from both multi-modal
fusion and self-supervised predictive regularization, most notably in
far-future prediction, which becomes especially important in practice. Our
uni-modal/bi-modal/bi-modal self-supervision scored 0.846/0.877/0.897
(0.824/0.855/0.886) and 0.817/0.820/0.858 (0.807/0.81/0.855) with mortality
(far-future mortality) and with vasopressor need (far-future vasopressor need)
