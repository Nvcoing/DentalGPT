"Accurate 3D Prediction of Missing Teeth in Diverse Patterns for Precise
  Dental Implant Planning","Lei Ma, Peng Xue, Yuning Gu, Yue Zhao, Min Zhu, Zhongxiang Ding, Dinggang Shen","In recent years, the demand for dental implants has surged, driven by their
high success rates and esthetic advantages. However, accurate prediction of
missing teeth for precise digital implant planning remains a challenge due to
the intricate nature of dental structures and the variability in tooth loss
patterns. This study presents a novel framework for accurate prediction of
missing teeth in different patterns, facilitating digital implant planning. The
proposed framework begins by estimating point-to-point correspondence among a
dataset of dental mesh models reconstructed from CBCT images of healthy
subjects. Subsequently, tooth dictionaries are constructed for each tooth type,
encoding their position and shape information based on the established
point-to-point correspondence. To predict missing teeth in a given dental mesh
model, sparse coefficients are learned by sparsely representing adjacent teeth
of the missing teeth using the corresponding tooth dictionaries. These
coefficients are then applied to the dictionaries of the missing teeth to
generate accurate predictions of their positions and shapes. The evaluation
results on real subjects shows that our proposed framework achieves an average
prediction error of 1.04mm for predictions of single missing tooth and an
average prediction error of 1.33mm for the prediction of 14 missing teeth,
which demonstrates its capability of accurately predicting missing teeth in
various patterns. By accurately predicting missing teeth, dental professionals
can improve the planning and placement of dental implants, leading to better
esthetic and functional outcomes for patients undergoing dental implant
procedures.",2023-07-16T05:52:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07953v1,dental implant
"Lack of corundum, carbon residues and revealing gaps on dental implants","Guy Florian Draenert, Gergo Mitov","Surface modification is an important topic to improve dental implants.
Corundum residues, which are part of current dental implant blasting,
disappeared on Straumann dental implants in recent publications. In our
investigations of the surface of 4 different Straumann implants using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) we
found the following three main findings: surfaces are nearly corundum-free,
disseminated gap-framed corundum particles and significant molecular carbon
residues. The data strongly suggest that Straumann applies a modified surface
technology on dental implants to remove corundum residues and involving unclear
carbons. One explanation could be, a Straumann patent involving a dextran
coating allowing easy corundum particle removal by aqueous solution, while
unintended molecular carbon residues cannot explain all findings. This change
of the production process without a new approval by the FDA would be a
violation of US federal law and the carbon bindings are a possible danger to
patients.",2022-09-13T04:45:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05728v1,dental implant
"Local tissue effects and peri-implant bone healing induced by implant
  surface treatment: an in vivo study in the sheep","Nicolas Rousseau, Ines Msolli, Patrick Chabrand, Arnaud Destainville, Olivier Richart, Jean-Louis Milan","Objective: The aim of this study was to assess, through biological analysis,
the local effects and osseointegration of dental implants incorporating surface
micro/nanofeatures compared to implants of identical design without surface
treatment. Background: Known to impact bone cell behavior, surface chemical and
topography modifications target improved osseointegration and long-term success
of dental implants. Very few studies assess the performance of implants
presenting both micro-and nanofeatures in vivo on the animal models used in
preclinical studies for medical device certification. Methods: Implant surfaces
were characterized in terms of topography and surface chemical composition.
After 4 weeks and 13 weeks of implantation in sheep femoral condyles, forty
implants were evaluated through micro-computed tomography, histopathologic, and
histomorphometric analyses. Results: No local adverse effects were observed
around implants. Histomorphometric analyses showed significantly higher
bone-to-implant contact in the coronal region of the surface treated implant at
week 4 and week 13, respectively 79.3$\pm$11.2% and 86.4$\pm$6.7%, compared to
the untreated implant's 68.3$\pm$8.8% and 74.8$\pm$13%. Micro-computed
tomography analyses revealed that healing patterns differed between coronal and
apical regions, with higher coronal boneto-implant contact at week 13.
Histopathologic results showed, at week 13, bone healing around the surface
treated implant with undistinguishable defect margins while the untreated
implant still presented bone condensation and traces of the initial drill
defect. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the surface treated implant not
only shows no deleterious effects on local tissues but also promotes faster
bone healing around the implant. (word count: 241",2021-04-09T07:33:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04223v1,dental implant
"TCSloT: Text Guided 3D Context and Slope Aware Triple Network for Dental
  Implant Position Prediction","Xinquan Yang, Jinheng Xie, Xuechen Li, Xuguang Li, Linlin Shen, Yongqiang Deng","In implant prosthesis treatment, the surgical guide of implant is used to
ensure accurate implantation. However, such design heavily relies on the manual

3D Context and Slope Aware Triple Network (TCSloT) which enables the perception
of contextual information from multiple adjacent slices and awareness of
variation of implant slopes. A Texture Variation Perception (TVP) module is
correspondingly elaborated to process the multiple slices and capture the
texture variation among slices and a Slope-Aware Loss (SAL) is proposed to
dynamically assign varying weights for the regression head. Additionally, we
design a conditional text guidance (CTG) module to integrate the text condition

"ImplantFormer: Vision Transformer based Implant Position Regression
  Using Dental CBCT Data","Xinquan Yang, Xuguang Li, Xuechen Li, Peixi Wu, Linlin Shen, Yongqiang Deng","Implant prosthesis is the most appropriate treatment for dentition defect or
dentition loss, which usually involves a surgical guide design process to
decide the implant position. However, such design heavily relies on the
subjective experiences of dentists. In this paper, a transformer-based Implant
Position Regression Network, ImplantFormer, is proposed to automatically
predict the implant position based on the oral CBCT data. We creatively propose
to predict the implant position using the 2D axial view of the tooth crown area
and fit a centerline of the implant to obtain the actual implant position at
the tooth root. Convolutional stem and decoder are designed to coarsely extract
image features before the operation of patch embedding and integrate
multi-level feature maps for robust prediction, respectively. As both
long-range relationship and local features are involved, our approach can
better represent global information and achieves better location performance.

"Simplify Implant Depth Prediction as Video Grounding: A Texture Perceive
  Implant Depth Prediction Network","Xinquan Yang, Xuguang Li, Xiaoling Luo, Leilei Zeng, Yudi Zhang, Linlin Shen, Yongqiang Deng","Surgical guide plate is an important tool for the dental implant surgery.
However, the design process heavily relies on the dentist to manually simulate
the implant angle and depth. When deep neural networks have been applied to

localizes the starting and ending time of the target video segment, in this
paper, we simplify the implant depth prediction as video grounding and develop
a Texture Perceive Implant Depth Prediction Network (TPNet), which enables us
to directly output the implant depth without complex measurements of oral bone.
TPNet consists of an implant region detector (IRD) and an implant depth
prediction network (IDPNet). IRD is an object detector designed to crop the
candidate implant volume from the CBCT, which greatly saves the computation
resource. IDPNet takes the cropped CBCT data to predict the implant depth. A

Resonant frequency analysis of dental implants,"D Rittel, A Dorogoy, G. Haiat, K Shemtov-Yona","Dental implant stability influences the decision on the determination of the
duration between implant insertion and loading, This work investigates the
resonant frequency analysis by means of a numerical model. The investigation is
done numerically through the determination of the eigenfrequencies and
performing a steady state response analyses using a commercial finite element
package. A peri-implant interface, of simultaneously varying stiffness
(density) and layer thickness is introduced in the numerical 3D model in order
to probe the sensitivity of the eigenfrequencies and steady state response to
an evolving weakened layer, in an attempt to identify the bone reconstruction
around the implant. For the first two modes, the resonant frequency is somewhat
insensitive to the healing process, unless the weakened layer is rather large
and compliant, like in the very early stages of the implantation. A ""Normalized
Healing Factor"" is devised in the spirit of the Implant Stability Quotient,
which can identify the healing process especially at the early stages after
implantation. The sensitivity of the RFA to changes of mechanical properties of
periprosthetic bone tissue seems relatively weak. Another indicator considering
the amplitude as well as the resonance frequency might be more adapted to bone
healing estimations. However, these results need to be verified experimentally
as well as clinically.",2019-05-17T07:59:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07154v1,dental implant

standard computed tomography. Despite this severe ill-posedness, the demand for
dental CBCT systems is rapidly growing because of their cost competitiveness
and low radiation dose. We then describe the limitations of existing methods in
the accurate restoration of the morphological structures of teeth using dental
CBCT data severely damaged by metal implants. We further discuss the usefulness
of panoramic images generated from CBCT data for accurate tooth segmentation.

purpose of this study was to compare the results obtained using these two
techniques applied to the same dental implants inserted in various bone

cortical thickness were considered to assess the effect of bone quality on the
respective indicators (UI and ISQ). The effect of the implant insertion depth

increase and UI values decrease as a function of trabecular density, cortical
thickness and the screwing of the implant. When the implant diameter varies,
the UI values are significantly different for all final drill diameters (except
for two), while the ISQ values are similar for all final drill diameters lower
than 3.2 mm and higher than 3.3 mm. The error on the estimation of parameters
with the QUS device is between 4 and 8 times lower compared to that made with

Two-Stream Regression Network for Dental Implant Position Prediction,"Xinquan Yang, Xuguang Li, Xuechen Li, Wenting Chen, Linlin Shen, Xin Li, Yongqiang Deng","In implant prosthesis treatment, the design of the surgical guide heavily
relies on the manual location of the implant position, which is subjective and
prone to doctor's experiences. When deep learning based methods has started to
be applied to address this problem, the space between teeth are various and
some of them might present similar texture characteristic with the actual
implant region. Both problems make a big challenge for the implant position
prediction. In this paper, we develop a two-stream implant position regression
framework (TSIPR), which consists of an implant region detector (IRD) and a
multi-scale patch embedding regression network (MSPENet), to address this

"The interplay between tissue healing and bone remodeling around
  immediately loaded tooth replacement implants","Soroush Irandoust, Sinan Muftu","Long-term bone healing/adaptation after a dental implant treatment starts
with diffusion of mesenchymal stem cells to the fracture callus and their
subsequent differentiation. The healing phase is followed by the
bone-remodeling phase. In this work, a mechano-regulatory cellular
differentiation model was used to simulate tissue healing around an immediately
loaded dental implant. All tissue types were modeled as poroelastic in the
healing phase. Material properties of the healing region were updated after
each loading cycle for 30 cycles (days). The tissue distribution in the healed
state was then used as the initial condition for the remodeling phase during
which regions healed into bone adapt their internal density with respect to a
homeostatic remodeling stimulus. The short- and long-term effects of
micro-motion on bone healing and remodeling were studied. Development of soft
tissue was observed both in the coronal region due to high fluid velocity, and
on the vertical sides of the healing-callus due to high shear stress. In cases
with small implant micromotion, tissue between the implant threads
differentiated into bone during the healing phase, but resorbed during
remodeling. In cases with large implant micromotion, higher percentage of the
healing region differentiated into soft tissue resulting in less volume
available for bone remodeling. But, the remaining bone region developed higher
density bone tissue. It was concluded that an optimal range of controlled
micromotion could be designed for a given implant in order to achieve the
desired functional properties.",2019-07-18T20:45:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08277v1,dental implant

behavior of Ti6Al4V alloy achieved when surface modified using femtosecond

performance and fatigue behavior of butt-joint implant-supported restorations.
However, failure of the implant component has been generally studied by
ignoring the prosthetic screw, which is frequently the critical restoration
component Purpose. Evaluate the effect of 3 main implant geometric parameters:
the implant body diameter, the platform diameter, and the implant-abutment
connection type (external versus internal butt-joint) on the fatigue life of
the prosthetic screw. The experimental values were further compared with the
theoretical ones obtained by using a previously published methodology M&M. 4
different designs of direct-to-implant dental restorations from the
manufacturer BTI were tested. Forty-eight fatigue tests were performed in an
axial fatigue testing machine according to ISO 14801. Linear regression models,
95% interval confidence bands for the linear regression, and 95% prediction
intervals of the fatigue load-life results were obtained and compared through
an analysis of covariance to determine the influence of the 3 parameters under
study on the fatigue behavior Results. Linear regression models showed a
statistical difference when the implant body diameter was increased by 1 mm; an
average 3.5-fold increase in fatigue life was observed. Increasing the implant
abutment connection diameter by 1.4 mm also showed a significant difference,
leading to 7-fold longer fatigue life on average. No significant statistical
evidence was found to demonstrate a difference in fatigue life between internal

  Panoramic X-ray","Weinan Song, Yuan Liang, Jiawei Yang, Kun Wang, Lei He","Panoramic X-ray (PX) provides a 2D picture of the patient's mouth in a
panoramic view to help dentists observe the invisible disease inside the gum.
However, it provides limited 2D information compared with cone-beam computed

the oral cavity but with more radiation dose and a higher price. Consequently,
it is of great interest to reconstruct the 3D structure from a 2D X-ray image,
which can greatly explore the application of X-ray imaging in dental surgeries.
In this paper, we propose a framework, named Oral-3D, to reconstruct the 3D

Specifically, we first train a generative model to learn the cross-dimension
transformation from 2D to 3D. Then we restore the shape of the oral cavity with
a deformation module with the dental arch curve, which can be obtained simply
by taking a photo of the patient's mouth. To be noted, Oral-3D can restore both
the density of bony tissues and the curved mandible surface. Experimental
results show that Oral-3D can efficiently and effectively reconstruct the 3D

  dental CBCT","T. Bayaraa, C. M. Hyun, T. J. Jang, S. M. Lee, J. K. Seo","This paper presents a two-stage method for beam hardening artifact correction
of dental cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT). The proposed artifact
reduction method is designed to improve the quality of maxillofacial imaging,
where soft tissue details are not required. Compared to standard CT, the
additional difficulty of dental CBCT comes from the problems caused by offset
detector, FOV truncation, and low signal-to-noise ratio due to low X-ray
irradiation. To address these problems, the proposed method primarily performs
a sinogram adjustment in the direction of enhancing data consistency,
considering the situation according to the FOV truncation and offset detector.
This sinogram correction algorithm significantly reduces beam hardening
artifacts caused by high-density materials such as teeth, bones, and metal
implants, while tending to amplify special types of noise. To suppress such
noise, a deep convolutional neural network is complementarily used, where CT
images adjusted by the sinogram correction are used as the input of the neural

Despite significant progress in metal artifact reduction techniques, challenges
persist owing to the intricate physical interactions between polychromatic
X-ray beams and metal objects, which are further compounded by the additional
effects associated with metal-tooth interactions and factors specific to the
dental CBCT data environment. To overcome these limitations, we propose an
implicit neural network that generates two distinct and informative tomographic
images. One image represents the monochromatic attenuation distribution at a
specific energy level, whereas the other captures the nonlinear beam-hardening
factor resulting from the polychromatic nature of X-ray beams. In contrast to
existing CT reconstruction techniques, the proposed method relies exclusively
on the Beer--Lambert law, effectively preventing the generation of
metal-induced artifacts during the backprojection process commonly implemented

protons range in the phantom, the radiation was measured using two pixeled
detectors with Si sensors. The Timepix3 (TPX3) detectors equipped with silicon
sensors measure in detail particle fluxes, dose rates (DR) and linear energy
transfer (LET) spectra for resolved particle types. Artificial intelligence
(AI) based-trained neural networks (NN) calibrated in well-defined radiation
fields were used to analyze and identify particles based on morphology and
characteristic spectral-tracking response. The beam was characterized and
single-particle tracks were registered and decomposed into particle-type
groups. The resulting particle fluxes in both setups are resolved into three
main classes of particles: i) protons, ii) electrons and photons iii) ions.
Protons are the main particle component responsible for dose deposition.
High-energy transfer particles (HETP), namely ions exhibited differences in
both dosimetric aspects that were investigated: DR and particle fluxes, when
the Ti implants were placed in the setup. The detailed multi-parametric
information of the secondary radiation field provides a comprehensive
understanding of the impact of Ti materials in proton therapy.",2024-09-27T07:57:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18521v1,dental implant
"Particle Tracking, Recognition and LET Evaluation of Out-of-Field Proton
  Therapy Delivered to a Phantom with Implants","Cristina Balan, Carlos Granja, Gennady Mytsin, Sergey Shvidky, Alexander Molokanov, Lukas Marek, Vasile Chis, Cristina Oancea","This study aims to assess the composition of scattered particles generated in
proton therapy for tumours situated proximal to titanium dental implants. The
investigation involves decomposing the mixed field and recording Linear Energy
Transfer (LET) spectra to quantify the influence of metallic dental inserts
located behind the tumour. A conformal proton beam was used to deliver the
treatment plan to an anthropomorphic head phantom with two types of implants
(Ti and plastic) inserted in the target volume. The stray radiation resulting
during the irradiation was detected by a hybrid semiconductor pixel detector
MiniPIX Timepix3 that was placed distal to the Spread-out Bragg peak.
Visualization and field decomposition of stray radiation were generated using
algorithms trained in particle recognition based on artificial intelligence
convolution neural networks (AI CNN). Spectral sensitive aspects of the
scattered radiation were collected using two angular positions of the detector
relative to the beam direction: 0 and 60{\deg}. Using AI CNN, 3 classes of
particles were identified: protons, electrons & photons, ions & fast neutrons.
Placing a Ti implant in the beam's path resulted in predominantly electrons and
photons, contributing 52.2%, whereas for plastic implants, the contribution was
65.4%. Scattered protons comprised 45.5% and 31.9% with and without Ti inserts,
respectively. The LET spectra was derived for each group of particles, with
values ranging from 0.01 to 7.5 keV{\mu}m-1 for Ti/plastic implants. The
low-LET component was primarily composed of electrons and photons, while the
high-LET component corresponded to protons and ions. This method, complemented
by directional maps, holds potential for evaluating and validating treatment
plans involving stray radiation near organs at risk, offering precise
discrimination of the mixt field, enhancing in this way the LET calculation.",2023-12-21T21:30:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14304v1,dental implant
"Tribocorrosion under galvanic interaction of Ti6Al4V and NiCr implant
  alloys","Camila Dias dos Reis Barros, Janaina Cardozo Rocha, Ivan Napoleão Bastos, José Antônio da Cunha Ponciano Gomes","Micromovements that occur in the joint between dental prostheses and implants
can lead to wear-induced degradation. This process can be enhanced by corrosion
in the oral environment influenced by the presence of solutions containing
fluoride. Moreover, the eventual galvanic interactions between NiCr and Ti
alloys can accelerate the wear-corrosion process. In this work, the
tribocorrosion process of Ti6Al4V and NiCr alloys used in dental implant
rehabilitations immersed in fluoride solutions at different pH values was
investigated. The galvanic interaction effect between the alloys was also
assessed. Tribocorrosion tests in corrosive media were performed with isolated
Ti6Al4V and NiCr alloys, followed by testing with both alloys in contact. The
media selected were based on fluoride concentrations and pH values that are
possible to be found in oral environments. Analysis of the surfaces after the
tribocorrosion tests was carried out using confocal laser microscopy. The wear
profile and volume losses were determined by confocal measurements. It was
concluded that the galvanic interaction between the alloys increased the
tribocorrosion resistance of Ti6Al4V, compared with that of the isolated
Ti6Al4V alloy. Ti6Al4V coupled with NiCr reduced the electrochemical potential
decay during sliding. The increased resistance was explained by the
electrochemical shift of the Ti6Al4V potential from active dissolution to the
passive domain.",2020-05-30T13:42:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00270v1,dental implant

  dental screws with improved osteogenic performance","Mathieu Maalouf, Yoan Di Maio, David Pallarés-Aldeiturriaga, Xxx Sedao, Lauriane Hivert, Steve Papa, Elisa Dalix, Mireille Thomas, Alain Guignandon, Virginie Dumas","Osseointegration is one of the key conditions for long term successful dental
implantation. To this end, titanium alloys undergo plethora of surface
treatments able to sustain osteogenic differentiation. For these surface
treatments, femtosecond laser (FSL) can generate precise and reproducible
surface patterns on titanium, avoiding thermal damage and chemical pollution.
We recently identify that laser-induced periodic surface structure (LIPSS) with
radial orientation, generated on model (flat) titanium surface, has a high
osteogenic potential. However, nano-texturing is time consuming. In the present
study, we aimed to reduce the texturing time of radial LIPSS, as well as
processing of large commercially available dental screws by ways of laser beam
engineering. Our objectives were to maintain at least osteogenic properties
demonstrated on model surfaces by adjusting laser beam diameters and to
demonstrate maintenance of performance with a dental screw texturing process
not exceeding 1 minute.We first textured model surfaces with radial LIPSS by
laser beams of different diameters, with surface impacts of 24$\mu$m, 80$\mu$m
or 180$\mu$m, named as R24, R80 or R180 respectively. Osteogenic performance of
human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were compared; seeded on polished control
surfaces and textured surfaces and subjected to osteogenic evaluation by
cell/matrix imaging, qRT-PCR and mineral deposition quantification. All
textured surfaces showed greater osteogenic potential than the control
surfaces, with significantly higher efficacy on R180 surface. Therefore, R180
pattern with large beam impacts was chosen for texturing on a dental screw and
its osteogenic activity was compared to that of a non-textured screw.
Interestingly, R180 required only 40 seconds to be textured on whole screws, on
which it preserved a high osteogenic potential. Thus, by using FSL technology,
we have improved the osteogenic potential of a topographic pattern while
optimizing and scaling up its processing time on a medical device.",2024-06-17T13:23:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11521v1,dental implant
Panorama Tomosynthesis from Head CBCT with Simulated Projection Geometry,"Anusree P. S., Bikram Keshari Parida, Seong Yong Moon, Wonsang You","Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Panoramic X-rays are the most
commonly used imaging modalities in dental health care. CBCT can produce
three-dimensional views of a patient's head, providing clinicians with better
diagnostic capability, whereas Panoramic X-ray can capture the entire
maxillofacial region in a single image. If the CBCT is already available, it
can be beneficial to synthesize a Panoramic X-ray, thereby avoiding an
immediate additional scan and extra radiation exposure. Existing methods focus
on delineating an approximate dental arch and creating orthogonal projections
along this arch. However, no golden standard is available for such dental arch
extractions, and this choice can affect the quality of synthesized X-rays. To
avoid such issues, we propose a novel method for synthesizing Panoramic X-rays
from diverse head CBCTs, employing a simulated projection geometry and dynamic
rotation centers. Our method effectively synthesized panoramic views from CBCT,
even for patients with missing or nonexistent teeth and in the presence of
severe metal implants. Our results demonstrate that this method can generate

incorporating grid-based attention gates into the skip connections. We
introduce oriented bounding box (OBB) generation through principal component

"Metal Artifact Reduction with Intra-Oral Scan Data for 3D Low Dose
  Maxillofacial CBCT Modeling","Chang Min Hyun, Taigyntuya Bayaraa, Hye Sun Yun, Tae Jun Jang, Hyoung Suk Park, Jin Keun Seo","Low-dose dental cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been increasingly
used for maxillofacial modeling. However, the presence of metallic inserts,
such as implants, crowns, and dental filling, causes severe streaking and
shading artifacts in a CBCT image and loss of the morphological structures of
the teeth, which consequently prevents accurate segmentation of bones. A
two-stage metal artifact reduction method is proposed for accurate 3D low-dose
maxillofacial CBCT modeling, where a key idea is to utilize explicit tooth
shape prior information from intra-oral scan data whose acquisition does not
require any extra radiation exposure. In the first stage, an image-to-image
deep learning network is employed to mitigate metal-related artifacts. To
improve the learning ability, the proposed network is designed to take
advantage of the intra-oral scan data as side-inputs and perform multi-task
learning of auxiliary tooth segmentation. In the second stage, a 3D
maxillofacial model is constructed by segmenting the bones from the dental CBCT
image corrected in the first stage. For accurate bone segmentation, weighted
thresholding is applied, wherein the weighting region is determined depending
on the geometry of the intra-oral scan data. Because acquiring a paired
training dataset of metal-artifact-free and metal artifact-affected dental CBCT
images is challenging in clinical practice, an automatic method of generating a
realistic dataset according to the CBCT physics model is introduced. Numerical
simulations and clinical experiments show the feasibility of the proposed

accuracy and robustness were evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) based on
the Hounsfield Units (HU) for three regions (whole body, bone, and air within

that performs fully automatic registration between a cone-beam CT image and an
optically scanned model. To build a robust and automatic initial registration
method, our method applies deep-pose regression neural networks in a reduced
domain (i.e., 2-dimensional image). Subsequently, fine registration is
performed via optimal clusters. Majority voting system achieves globally
optimal transformations while each cluster attempts to optimize local
transformation parameters. The coherency of clusters determines their candidacy
for the optimal cluster set. The outlying regions in the iso-surface are
effectively removed based on the consensus among the optimal clusters. The
accuracy of registration was evaluated by the Euclidean distance of 10
landmarks on a scanned model which were annotated by the experts in the field.
The experiments show that the proposed method's registration accuracy, measured
in landmark distance, outperforms other existing methods by 30.77% to 70%. In
addition to achieving high accuracy, our proposed method requires neither
human-interactions nor priors (e.g., iso-surface extraction). The main
significance of our study is twofold: 1) the employment of light-weighted

"High-low level support vector regression prediction approach (HL-SVR)
  for data modeling with input parameters of unequal sample sizes","Maolin Shi, Wei Sun, Xueguan Song, Hongyou Li","Support vector regression (SVR) has been widely used to reduce the high
computational cost of computer simulation. SVR assumes the input parameters
have equal sample sizes, but unequal sample sizes are often encountered in
engineering practices. To solve this issue, a new prediction approach based on
SVR, namely as high-low-level SVR approach (HL-SVR) is proposed for data
modeling of input parameters of unequal sample sizes in this paper. The
proposed approach is consisted of low-level SVR models for the input parameters
of larger sample sizes and high-level SVR model for the input parameters of
smaller sample sizes. For each training point of the input parameters of
smaller sample sizes, one low-level SVR model is built based on its
corresponding input parameters of larger sample sizes and their responses of
interest. The high-level SVR model is built based on the obtained responses
from the low-level SVR models and the input parameters of smaller sample sizes.
Several numerical examples are used to validate the performance of HL-SVR. The
experimental results indicate that HL-SVR can produce more accurate prediction
results than conventional SVR. The proposed approach is applied on the stress
analysis of dental implant, which the structural parameters have massive
samples but the material of implant can only be selected from several Ti and
its alloys. The prediction performance of the proposed approach is much better

thread rolling and cutting. Material and methods. The thread profiles were
measured in an optical measuring machine, the residual stresses in an X-ray

roll-threaded screws (P=1) without affecting static behavior, which showed
statistically similar static strengths (P=.54). However, the thread profile in

metallic implants has increased demand for the reduction of metal artifacts in
the field of dental and medical radiography. However, it is a challenging issue
due to the serious difficulties in analyzing the X-ray data, which depends
nonlinearly on the distribution of the metallic subject. In this paper, we
found that the metal streaking artifacts cause mainly from the boundary
geometry of the metal region. The metal streaking artifacts are produced only
when the wavefront set of the Radon transform of the characteristic function of
a metal region does not contain the wavefront set of the square of the Radon

"Geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on simple surfaces or
  on spaces of constant curvature",Hiroyuki Chihara,"The X-ray transform on the plane or on the three-dimensional Euclidean space
can be considered as the measurements of CT scanners for normal human tissue.
If the human body contains metal regions such as dental implants, stents in
blood vessels, metal bones, etc., the beam hardening effect for the energy
level of the X-ray causes streaking artifacts in its CT image. More precisely,
if there are two strictly convex metal regions contained in the cross-section
of normal human tissue, then streaking artifacts occur along the common tangent
lines of the two regions. In this paper we study the geodesic X-ray transform
and streaking artifacts on nontrapping simple compact Riemannian manifolds with
strictly convex boundaries. We show that the streaking artifacts result from
the propagation of conormal singularities on the boundary of metal regions
along the common tangent geodesics under the strong and seemingly strange
assumption that the manifolds are two dimensional or spaces of constant
curvature. This condition ensures that every Jacobi field takes the form of the
product of a scalar function and parallel transport along the geodesic. Our
results clarify the geometric meaning of the theory, which was imperceptible in
the known results on the Euclidean space.",2024-02-10T07:51:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06899v1,dental implant

"Self-Supervised Learning with Masked Image Modeling for Teeth Numbering,
  Detection of Dental Restorations, and Instance Segmentation in Dental
  Panoramic Radiographs","Amani Almalki, Longin Jan Latecki","The computer-assisted radiologic informative report is currently emerging in
dental practice to facilitate dental care and reduce time consumption in manual
panoramic radiographic interpretation. However, the amount of dental
radiographs for training is very limited, particularly from the point of view
of deep learning. This study aims to utilize recent self-supervised learning
methods like SimMIM and UM-MAE to increase the model efficiency and
understanding of the limited number of dental radiographs. We use the Swin
Transformer for teeth numbering, detection of dental restorations, and instance
segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that
applied self-supervised learning methods to Swin Transformer on dental
panoramic radiographs. Our results show that the SimMIM method obtained the
highest performance of 90.4% and 88.9% on detecting teeth and dental
restorations and instance segmentation, respectively, increasing the average
precision by 13.4 and 12.8 over the random initialization baseline. Moreover,
we augment and correct the existing dataset of panoramic radiographs. The code
and the dataset are available at https://github.com/AmaniHAlmalki/DentalMIM.",2022-10-20T16:50:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11404v1,dental implant
"Semantic decomposition Network with Contrastive and Structural
  Constraints for Dental Plaque Segmentation","Jian Shi, Baoli Sun, Xinchen Ye, Zhihui Wang, Xiaolong Luo, Jin Liu, Heli Gao, Haojie Li","Segmenting dental plaque from images of medical reagent staining provides
valuable information for diagnosis and the determination of follow-up treatment
plan. However, accurate dental plaque segmentation is a challenging task that
requires identifying teeth and dental plaque subjected to semantic-blur regions
(i.e., confused boundaries in border regions between teeth and dental plaque)
and complex variations of instance shapes, which are not fully addressed by
existing methods. Therefore, we propose a semantic decomposition network
(SDNet) that introduces two single-task branches to separately address the
segmentation of teeth and dental plaque and designs additional constraints to
learn category-specific features for each branch, thus facilitating the
semantic decomposition and improving the performance of dental plaque
segmentation. Specifically, SDNet learns two separate segmentation branches for
teeth and dental plaque in a divide-and-conquer manner to decouple the
entangled relation between them. Each branch that specifies a category tends to
yield accurate segmentation. To help these two branches better focus on
category-specific features, two constraint modules are further proposed: 1)
contrastive constraint module (CCM) to learn discriminative feature
representations by maximizing the distance between different category
representations, so as to reduce the negative impact of semantic-blur regions
on feature extraction; 2) structural constraint module (SCM) to provide
complete structural information for dental plaque of various shapes by the
supervision of an boundary-aware geometric constraint. Besides, we construct a
large-scale open-source Stained Dental Plaque Segmentation dataset (SDPSeg),
which provides high-quality annotations for teeth and dental plaque.
Experimental results on SDPSeg datasets show SDNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance.",2022-08-12T14:10:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06283v1,dental implant
"Generative Adversarial Networks for Dental Patient Identity Protection
  in Orthodontic Educational Imaging","Mingchuan Tian, Wilson Weixun Lu, Kelvin Weng Chiong Foong, Eugene Loh","Objectives: This research introduces a novel area-preserving Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) inversion technique for effectively de-identifying
dental patient images. This innovative method addresses privacy concerns while
preserving key dental features, thereby generating valuable resources for
dental education and research.
  Methods: We enhanced the existing GAN Inversion methodology to maximize the
preservation of dental characteristics within the synthesized images. A
comprehensive technical framework incorporating several deep learning models
was developed to provide end-to-end development guidance and practical
application for image de-identification.
  Results: Our approach was assessed with varied facial pictures, extensively
used for diagnosing skeletal asymmetry and facial anomalies. Results
demonstrated our model's ability to adapt the context from one image to
another, maintaining compatibility, while preserving dental features essential
for oral diagnosis and dental education. A panel of five clinicians conducted
an evaluation on a set of original and GAN-processed images. The generated
images achieved effective de-identification, maintaining the realism of
important dental features and were deemed useful for dental diagnostics and
education.
  Clinical Significance: Our GAN model and the encompassing framework can
streamline the de-identification process of dental patient images, enhancing
efficiency in dental education. This method improves students' diagnostic
capabilities by offering more exposure to orthodontic malocclusions.
Furthermore, it facilitates the creation of de-identified datasets for broader
2D image research at major research institutions.",2023-07-05T04:14:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02019v1,dental implant
"Sub-Band-Gap Absorption Mechanisms Involving Oxygen Vacancies in
  Hydroxyapatite","Vladimir S. Bystrov, Leon A. Avakyan, Ekaterina V. Paramonova, José Coutinho","Hydroxyapatite (HAp) is a widely used biomaterial for the preparation of bone
and dental implants. Despite the relevance of HAp in medicine, exciting
applications involving this material as a bio-compatible photocatalyst, depend
on how well we understand its fundamental properties. Experimental evidence
suggests that oxygen vacancies play a critical role in the production of
surface radicals upon exposure of HAp to ultra-violet (UV) light. However, very
little is known about the underlying physical and chemical details. We present
a hybrid density-functional study of the structural and electronic properties
of oxygen vacancies in large HAp supercells within the plane-wave formalism. We
find that under equilibrium conditions, vacancies occur either as a simple
vacant oxygen site (in the neutral charge state), or as extended structures
replacing several crystalline moieties (in the double plus charge state). Large
atomic relaxations upon ionization make the oxygen vacancy a negative-$U$
defect, where the single plus charge state is metastable, being only accessible
under UV excitation. From inspection of the transition levels, we find that
electron promotion from the valence band top to the donor state of the vacancy,
involves a zero-phonon transition of 3.6-3.9 eV. This mechanism is the most
likely explanation to the 3.4-4.0 eV absorption onset for the observation of
photocatalysis using HAp under persistent UV illumination.",2019-03-03T21:19:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00992v1,dental implant
Superiorized method for metal artifact reduction,"T. Humphries, J. Wang","Metal artifact reduction (MAR) is a challenging problem in computed
tomography (CT) imaging. A popular class of MAR methods replace sinogram
measurements that are corrupted by metal with artificial data. While these
``projection completion'' approaches are successful in eliminating severe
artifacts, secondary artifacts may be introduced by the artificial data. In
this paper, we propose an approach which uses projection completion to generate
a prior image, which is then incorporated into an iterative reconstruction
algorithm based on the superiorization framework. The prior image is
reconstructed using normalized metal artifact reduction (NMAR), a popular
projection completion approach. The iterative algorithm is a modified version
of the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART), which reduces
artifacts by incorporating a polyenergetic forward model, least-squares
weighting, and superiorization. The penalty function used for superiorization
is a weighted average between a total variation (TV) term and a term promoting
similarity with the prior image, similar to penalty functions used in prior
image constrained compressive sensing. Because the prior is largely free of
severe metal artifacts, these artifacts are discouraged from arising during
iterative reconstruction; additionally, because the iterative approach uses the
original projection data, it is able to recover information that is lost during
the NMAR process. We perform numerical experiments modeling a simple geometric
object, as well as several more realistic scenarios such as metal pins,
bilateral hip implants, and dental fillings placed within an anatomical
phantom. The proposed iterative algorithm is largely successful at eliminating
severe metal artifacts as well as secondary artifacts introduced by the NMAR
process, especially lost edges of bone structures in the neighborhood of the
metal regions.",2020-03-10T00:47:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04479v1,dental implant
