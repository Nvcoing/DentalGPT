"PaXNet: Dental Caries Detection in Panoramic X-ray using Ensemble
  Transfer Learning and Capsule Classifier","Arman Haghanifar, Mahdiyar Molahasani Majdabadi, Seok-Bum Ko","Dental caries is one of the most chronic diseases involving the majority of
the population during their lifetime. Caries lesions are typically diagnosed by
radiologists relying only on their visual inspection to detect via dental
x-rays. In many cases, dental caries is hard to identify using x-rays and can
be misinterpreted as shadows due to different reasons such as low image
quality. Hence, developing a decision support system for caries detection has
been a topic of interest in recent years. Here, we propose an automatic
diagnosis system to detect dental caries in Panoramic images for the first
time, to the best of authors' knowledge. The proposed model benefits from
various pretrained deep learning models through transfer learning to extract
relevant features from x-rays and uses a capsule network to draw prediction
results. On a dataset of 470 Panoramic images used for features extraction,
including 240 labeled images for classification, our model achieved an accuracy
score of 86.05\% on the test set. The obtained score demonstrates acceptable
detection performance and an increase in caries detection speed, as long as the
challenges of using Panoramic x-rays of real patients are taken into account.
Among images with caries lesions in the test set, our model acquired recall
scores of 69.44\% and 90.52\% for mild and severe ones, confirming the fact
that severe caries spots are more straightforward to detect and efficient mild
caries detection needs a more robust and larger dataset. Considering the
novelty of current research study as using Panoramic images, this work is a
step towards developing a fully automated efficient decision support system to
assist domain experts.",2020-12-26T03:00:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13666v1,dental caries
ToMoBrush: Exploring Dental Health Sensing using a Sonic Toothbrush,"Kuang Yuan, Mohamed Ibrahim, Yiwen Song, Guoxiang Deng, Suvendra Vijayan, Robert Nerone, Akshay Gadre, Swarun Kumar","Early detection of dental disease is crucial to prevent adverse outcomes.
Today, dental X-rays are currently the most accurate gold standard for dental
disease detection. Unfortunately, regular X-ray exam is still a privilege for
billions of people around the world. In this paper, we ask: ""Can we develop a
low-cost sensing system that enables dental self-examination in the comfort of
one's home?""
  This paper presents ToMoBrush, a dental health sensing system that explores
using off-the-shelf sonic toothbrushes for dental condition detection. Our
solution leverages the fact that a sonic toothbrush produces rich acoustic
signals when in contact with teeth, which contain important information about
each tooth's status. ToMoBrush extracts tooth resonance signatures from the
acoustic signals to characterize varied dental health conditions of the teeth.
We evaluate ToMoBrush on 19 participants and dental-standard models for
detecting common dental problems including caries, calculus, and food
impaction, achieving a detection ROC-AUC of 0.90, 0.83, and 0.88 respectively.
Interviews with dental experts validate ToMoBrush's potential in enhancing
at-home dental healthcare.",2024-02-02T22:05:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01933v1,dental caries
Detection of Tooth caries in Bitewing Radiographs using Deep Learning,"Muktabh Mayank Srivastava, Pratyush Kumar, Lalit Pradhan, Srikrishna Varadarajan","We develop a Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system, which enhances the
performance of dentists in detecting wide range of dental caries. The CAD
System achieves this by acting as a second opinion for the dentists with way
higher sensitivity on the task of detecting cavities than the dentists
themselves. We develop annotated dataset of more than 3000 bitewing radiographs
and utilize it for developing a system for automated diagnosis of dental
caries. Our system consists of a deep fully convolutional neural network (FCNN)
consisting 100+ layers, which is trained to mark caries on bitewing
radiographs. We have compared the performance of our proposed system with three

A mathematical model for the progression of dental caries,"Rene Fabregas, Jacob Rubinstein","A model for the progression of dental caries is derived. The analysis starts
at the microscopic reaction and diffusion process. The local equations are
averaged to derive a set of macroscopic equations. The global system includes
features such as anisotropic diffusion and local changes in the geometry due to
the enamel melting. The equations are then solved numerically. The simulations
highlight the effect of anisotropy. In addition we draw conclusions on the
progression rate of caries, and discuss them in light of a number of
experiments.",2025-01-13T16:12:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07619v1,dental caries
"A Sequential Framework for Detection and Classification of Abnormal
  Teeth in Panoramic X-rays","Tudor Dascalu, Shaqayeq Ramezanzade, Azam Bakhshandeh, Lars Bjorndal, Bulat Ibragimov","This paper describes our solution for the Dental Enumeration and Diagnosis on
Panoramic X-rays Challenge at MICCAI 2023. Our approach consists of a
multi-step framework tailored to the task of detecting and classifying abnormal
teeth. The solution includes three sequential stages: dental instance
detection, healthy instance filtering, and abnormal instance classification. In
the first stage, we employed a Faster-RCNN model for detecting and identifying
teeth. In subsequent stages, we designed a model that merged the encoding
pathway of a pretrained U-net, optimized for dental lesion detection, with the
Vgg16 architecture. The resulting model was first used for filtering out
healthy teeth. Then, any identified abnormal teeth were categorized,
potentially falling into one or more of the following conditions: embedded,
periapical lesion, caries, deep caries. The model performing dental instance
detection achieved an AP score of 0.49. The model responsible for identifying
healthy teeth attained an F1 score of 0.71. Meanwhile, the model trained for
multi-label dental disease classification achieved an F1 score of 0.76. The

"Design of quantum correlation based automatic focus detection system
  during dental laser operation","Binh Xuan Cao, Duc An Pham","Dental laser has been developed recently and gradually replaced the
conventional dental treatment methods, especially in dental caries removal. The
utility of laser in dentistry contributes to reduce the pain during surgery and
decrease the risk of sequelae after surgery. Although bringing about several
beneficial properties such as excellent directionality, high speed, ultra-tiny
active area and tunable energy concentration, laser is still quite limited in
dental surgery because of the difficulty in real-time high precision detection
of laser focus during the operation. In this study, a cutting-edge optical
system for real-time focus detection during dental laser operation employing
the quantum entanglement of photon pairs created via spontaneous parametric
downconversion (SPDC) is presented. Defocusing distance of the specimen which
is used as the sample tooth can be determined precisely through spatial
correlation of photons arriving at the detectors. The proposed technique can be
applied to design automatic focus detection system for use in dental laser
operation.",2019-07-25T08:15:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07610v5,dental caries
"Bayesian Hierarchical Spatial Model for Small Area Estimation with
  Non-ignorable Nonresponses and Its Applications to the NHANES Dental Caries
  Assessments","Ick Hoon Jin, Fang Liu, Evercita C. Eugenio, Kisung You, Suyu Liu","The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a major
program of the National Center for Health Statistics, designed to assess the
health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The
analysis of NHANES dental caries data faces several challenges, including (1)
the data were collected using a complex, multistage, stratified,
unequal-probability sampling design; (2) the sample size of some primary
sampling units (PSU), e.g., counties, is very small; (3) the measures of dental
caries have complicated structure and correlation, and (4) there is a
substantial percentage of nonresponses, for which the missing data are expected
to be not missing at random or non-ignorable. We propose a Bayesian
hierarchical spatial model to address these analysis challenges. We develop a
two-level Potts model that closely resembles the caries evolution process and
captures complicated spatial correlations between teeth and surfaces of the
teeth. By adding Bayesian hierarchies to the Potts model, we account for the
multistage survey sampling design and also enable information borrowing across
PSUs for small area estimation. We incorporate sampling weights by including
them as a covariate in the model and adopt flexible B-splines to achieve robust
inference. We account for non-ignorable missing outcomes and covariates using
the selection model. We use data augmentation coupled with the noisy exchange
sampler to obtain the posterior of model parameters that involve
doubly-intractable normalizing constants. Our analysis results show strong
spatial associations between teeth and tooth surfaces and that dental hygienic
factors, fluorosis and sealant reduce the risks of having dental diseases.",2018-10-12T00:18:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05297v3,dental caries
"Interpretable and Interactive Deep Multiple Instance Learning for Dental
  Caries Classification in Bitewing X-rays","Benjamin Bergner, Csaba Rohrer, Aiham Taleb, Martha Duchrau, Guilherme De Leon, Jonas Almeida Rodrigues, Falk Schwendicke, Joachim Krois, Christoph Lippert","We propose a simple and efficient image classification architecture based on
deep multiple instance learning, and apply it to the challenging task of caries
detection in dental radiographs. Technically, our approach contributes in two
ways: First, it outputs a heatmap of local patch classification probabilities
despite being trained with weak image-level labels. Second, it is amenable to
learning from segmentation labels to guide training. In contrast to existing
methods, the human user can faithfully interpret predictions and interact with
the model to decide which regions to attend to. Experiments are conducted on a
large clinical dataset of $\sim$38k bitewings ($\sim$316k teeth), where we
achieve competitive performance compared to various baselines. When guided by
an external caries segmentation model, a significant improvement in
classification and localization performance is observed.",2021-12-17T14:09:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09694v2,dental caries
"Object Detection for Caries or Pit and Fissure Sealing Requirement in
  Children's First Permanent Molars","Chenyao Jiang, Shiyao Zhai, Hengrui Song, Yuqing Ma, Yachen Fan, Yancheng Fang, Dongmei Yu, Canyang Zhang, Sanyang Han, Runming Wang, Yong Liu, Jianbo Li, Peiwu Qin","Dental caries is one of the most common oral diseases that, if left
untreated, can lead to a variety of oral problems. It mainly occurs inside the
pits and fissures on the occlusal/buccal/palatal surfaces of molars and
children are a high-risk group for pit and fissure caries in permanent molars.
Pit and fissure sealing is one of the most effective methods that is widely
used in prevention of pit and fissure caries. However, current detection of
pits and fissures or caries depends primarily on the experienced dentists,
which ordinary parents do not have, and children may miss the remedial
treatment without timely detection. To address this issue, we present a method
to autodetect caries and pit and fissure sealing requirements using oral photos
taken by smartphones. We use the YOLOv5 and YOLOX models and adopt a tiling
strategy to reduce information loss during image pre-processing. The best
result for YOLOXs model with tiling strategy is 72.3 mAP.5, while the best
result without tiling strategy is 71.2. YOLOv5s6 model with/without tiling

"AI-Dentify: Deep learning for proximal caries detection on bitewing
  x-ray -- HUNT4 Oral Health Study","Javier Pérez de Frutos, Ragnhild Holden Helland, Shreya Desai, Line Cathrine Nymoen, Thomas Langø, Theodor Remman, Abhijit Sen","Background: Dental caries diagnosis requires the manual inspection of
diagnostic bitewing images of the patient, followed by a visual inspection and
probing of the identified dental pieces with potential lesions. Yet the use of
artificial intelligence, and in particular deep-learning, has the potential to
aid in the diagnosis by providing a quick and informative analysis of the
bitewing images.
  Methods: A dataset of 13,887 bitewings from the HUNT4 Oral Health Study were
annotated individually by six different experts, and used to train three
different object detection deep-learning architectures: RetinaNet (ResNet50),
YOLOv5 (M size), and EfficientDet (D0 and D1 sizes). A consensus dataset of 197
images, annotated jointly by the same six dentist, was used for evaluation. A
five-fold cross validation scheme was used to evaluate the performance of the
AI models.
  Results: he trained models show an increase in average precision and
F1-score, and decrease of false negative rate, with respect to the dental
clinicians. When compared against the dental clinicians, the YOLOv5 model shows
the largest improvement, reporting 0.647 mean average precision, 0.548 mean
F1-score, and 0.149 mean false negative rate. Whereas the best annotators on
each of these metrics reported 0.299, 0.495, and 0.164 respectively.
  Conclusion: Deep-learning models have shown the potential to assist dental
professionals in the diagnosis of caries. Yet, the task remains challenging due
to the artifacts natural to the bitewing images.",2023-09-30T12:17:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00354v3,dental caries
"Modeling Zero-Inflated Correlated Dental Data through Gaussian Copulas
  and Approximate Bayesian Computation","Anish Mukherjee, Jeremy T. Gaskins, Shoumi Sarkar, Steven Levy, Somnath Datta","We develop a new longitudinal count data regression model that accounts for
zero-inflation and spatio-temporal correlation across responses. This project
is motivated by an analysis of Iowa Fluoride Study (IFS) data, a longitudinal
cohort study with data on caries (cavity) experience scores measured for each
tooth across five time points. To that end, we use a hurdle model for
zero-inflation with two parts: the presence model indicating whether a count is
non-zero through logistic regression and the severity model that considers the
non-zero counts through a shifted Negative Binomial distribution allowing
overdispersion. To incorporate dependence across measurement occasion and
teeth, these marginal models are embedded within a Gaussian copula that
introduces spatio-temporal correlations. A distinct advantage of this
formulation is that it allows us to determine covariate effects with
population-level (marginal) interpretations in contrast to mixed model choices.
Standard Bayesian sampling from such a model is infeasible, so we use
approximate Bayesian computing for inference. This approach is applied to the
IFS data to gain insight into the risk factors for dental caries and the
correlation structure across teeth and time.",2024-10-17T18:18:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13949v2,dental caries

Flanders (Belgium), the joint time to caries distribution of permanent first

multivariate continuous doubly-interval-censored data since: (i) the emergence
time of a tooth and the time it experiences caries were recorded yearly, and
(ii) events on teeth of the same child are dependent. To model the joint
distribution of the emergence times and the times to caries, we propose a

Perturbation method to model enamel caries progress,"Katarzyna D. Lewandowska, Tadeusz Kosztolowicz","We develop a theoretical model of the carious lesion progress caused by acids
diffusing into the tooth enamel from the dental plaque. The acids react with
static hydroxyapatite, which leads to demineralization of the enamel, and
consequently to the development of the carious lesion. The model utilizes the
diffusion-reaction equations with one static and one mobile reactant where the
reaction term is proportional to the product of concentrations of acids and of
mineral. The changes of concentrations are calculated approximately by means of
a perturbation method. The analytical approximate solutions are compared with
the numerical ones and experimental data.",2007-07-02T11:10:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.0194v2,dental caries
Spline regression for zero-inflated models,"T. Opitz, P. Tramini, N. Molinari","We propose a regression model for count data when the classical generalized
linear model approach is too rigid due to a high outcome of zero counts and a
nonlinear influence of continuous covariates. Zero-Inflation is applied to take
into account the presence of excess zeros with separate link functions for the
zero and the nonzero component. Nonlinearity in covariates is captured by
spline functions based on B-splines. Our algorithm relies on maximum-likelihood
estimation and allows for adaptive box-constrained knots, thus improving the
goodness of the spline fit and allowing for detection of sensitivity
changepoints. A simulation study substantiates the numerical stability of the
algorithm to infer such models. The AIC criterion is shown to serve well for
model selection, in particular if nonlinearities are weak such that BIC tends
to overly simplistic models. We fit the introduced models to real data of
children's dental sanity, linking caries counts with the so-called
Body-Mass-Index (BMI) and other socioeconomic factors. This reveals a puzzling
nonmonotonic influence of BMI on caries counts which is yet to be explained by

we propose a multistage deep learning-based system for cavity detection. We
create a dataset containing RGB oral images labeled manually by dental

"Analyzing zero-inflated clustered longitudinal ordinal outcomes using
  GEE-type models with an application to dental fluorosis studies","Shoumi Sarkar, Anish Mukherjee, Jeremy Gaskins, Steven Levy, Peihua Qiu, Somnath Datta","Motivated by the Iowa Fluoride Study (IFS) dataset, which comprises
zero-inflated multi-level ordinal responses on tooth fluorosis, we develop an

includes observations for age 23, whereas earlier works were restricted to ages
9, 13, and/or 17 according to the participants' ages at the time of
measurement. The adoption of a frequentist perspective enhances the
interpretability to a broader audience. Over a choice of several covariance
structures, separate models are formulated for the presence (zero versus
non-zero score) and severity (non-zero ordinal scores) of fluorosis, which are

"Mediation Analysis for Count and Zero-Inflated Count Data without
  Sequential Ignorability and Its Application in Dental Studies","Zijian Guo, Dylan S. Small, Stuart A. Gansky, Jing Cheng","Mediation analysis seeks to understand the mechanism by which a treatment
affects an outcome. Count or zero-inflated count outcome are common in many
studies in which mediation analysis is of interest. For example, in dental
studies, outcomes such as decayed, missing and filled teeth are typically zero
inflated. Existing mediation analysis approaches for count data assume
sequential ignorability of the mediator. This is often not plausible because
the mediator is not randomized so that there are unmeasured confounders
associated with the mediator and the outcome. In this paper, we develop causal
methods based on instrumental variable (IV) approaches for mediation analysis
for count data possibly with a lot of zeros that do not require the assumption
of sequential ignorability. We first define the direct and indirect effect
ratios for those data, and then propose estimating equations and use empirical
likelihood to estimate the direct and indirect effects consistently. A
sensitivity analysis is proposed for violations of the IV exclusion restriction
assumption. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method works well for
different types of outcomes under different settings. Our method is applied to

periodontal bone loss and calculus. The study compares the detection
performance of dentists using the deep learning algorithm to the prior
performance of these dentists evaluating the images without algorithmic
assistance. Calculating the marginal profit and loss of performance from the
annotated paired image data allows for a quantification of the hypothesized
change in sensitivity and specificity. The statistical significance of these
results is extensively proven using both McNemar's test and the binomial
hypothesis test. The average sensitivity increases from $60.7\%$ to $85.9\%$,
while the average specificity slightly decreases from $94.5\%$ to $92.7\%$. We
prove that the increase of the area under the localization ROC curve (AUC) is

bounded by the $95\%$ confidence intervals ${[}0.54, 0.65{]}$ and ${[}0.82,

self/cross-gating layers to emphasize particular semantics meanwhile
maintaining the divergence between token embeddings. Besides, we collect 3) the

infer consensus categories by adding item-level effects for difficulty,
discriminativeness, and guessability. We further show how to constrain the
bimodal posterior of these models to avoid (or if necessary, allow) adversarial
raters. We validate our model's goodness of fit with posterior predictive
checks, the Bayesian analogue of $\chi^2$ tests. Dawid and Skene's model is
rejected by goodness of fit tests, whereas our new model, which adjusts for
item heterogeneity, is not rejected. We illustrate our new model with two

"Construction of unbiased dental template and parametric dental model for
  precision digital dentistry","Lei Ma, Jingyang Zhang, Ke Deng, Peng Xue, Zhiming Cui, Yu Fang, Minhui Tang, Yue Zhao, Min Zhu, Zhongxiang Ding, Dinggang Shen","Dental template and parametric dental models are important tools for various
applications in digital dentistry. However, constructing an unbiased dental
template and accurate parametric dental models remains a challenging task due
to the complex anatomical and morphological dental structures and also low
volume ratio of the teeth. In this study, we develop an unbiased dental
template by constructing an accurate dental atlas from CBCT images with
guidance of teeth segmentation. First, to address the challenges, we propose to
enhance the CBCT images and their segmentation images, including image
cropping, image masking and segmentation intensity reassigning. Then, we
further use the segmentation images to perform co-registration with the CBCT
images to generate an accurate dental atlas, from which an unbiased dental
template can be generated. By leveraging the unbiased dental template, we
construct parametric dental models by estimating point-to-point correspondences
between the dental models and employing Principal Component Analysis to
determine shape subspaces of the parametric dental models. A total of 159 CBCT
images of real subjects are collected to perform the constructions.
Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of our proposed method in

Example Mining for Incremental Learning in Medical Imaging,"Pratyush Kumar, Muktabh Mayank Srivastava","Incremental Learning is well known machine learning approach wherein the
weights of the learned model are dynamically and gradually updated to
generalize on new unseen data without forgetting the existing knowledge.
Incremental learning proves to be time as well as resource-efficient solution
for deployment of deep learning algorithms in real world as the model can
automatically and dynamically adapt to new data as and when annotated data
becomes available. The development and deployment of Computer Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) tools in medical domain is another scenario, where incremental learning
becomes very crucial as collection and annotation of a comprehensive dataset
spanning over multiple pathologies and imaging machines might take years.
However, not much has so far been explored in this direction. In the current

"Semantic decomposition Network with Contrastive and Structural
  Constraints for Dental Plaque Segmentation","Jian Shi, Baoli Sun, Xinchen Ye, Zhihui Wang, Xiaolong Luo, Jin Liu, Heli Gao, Haojie Li","Segmenting dental plaque from images of medical reagent staining provides
valuable information for diagnosis and the determination of follow-up treatment
plan. However, accurate dental plaque segmentation is a challenging task that
requires identifying teeth and dental plaque subjected to semantic-blur regions
(i.e., confused boundaries in border regions between teeth and dental plaque)
and complex variations of instance shapes, which are not fully addressed by
existing methods. Therefore, we propose a semantic decomposition network
(SDNet) that introduces two single-task branches to separately address the
segmentation of teeth and dental plaque and designs additional constraints to
learn category-specific features for each branch, thus facilitating the
semantic decomposition and improving the performance of dental plaque
segmentation. Specifically, SDNet learns two separate segmentation branches for
teeth and dental plaque in a divide-and-conquer manner to decouple the
entangled relation between them. Each branch that specifies a category tends to
yield accurate segmentation. To help these two branches better focus on
category-specific features, two constraint modules are further proposed: 1)
contrastive constraint module (CCM) to learn discriminative feature
representations by maximizing the distance between different category
representations, so as to reduce the negative impact of semantic-blur regions
on feature extraction; 2) structural constraint module (SCM) to provide
complete structural information for dental plaque of various shapes by the
supervision of an boundary-aware geometric constraint. Besides, we construct a
large-scale open-source Stained Dental Plaque Segmentation dataset (SDPSeg),

  Methods: We enhanced the existing GAN Inversion methodology to maximize the
preservation of dental characteristics within the synthesized images. A
comprehensive technical framework incorporating several deep learning models
was developed to provide end-to-end development guidance and practical
application for image de-identification.
  Results: Our approach was assessed with varied facial pictures, extensively

DArch: Dental Arch Prior-assisted 3D Tooth Instance Segmentation,"Liangdong Qiu, Chongjie Ye, Pei Chen, Yunbi Liu, Xiaoguang Han, Shuguang Cui","Automatic tooth instance segmentation on 3D dental models is a fundamental
task for computer-aided orthodontic treatments. Existing learning-based methods
rely heavily on expensive point-wise annotations. To alleviate this problem, we
are the first to explore a low-cost annotation way for 3D tooth instance
segmentation, i.e., labeling all tooth centroids and only a few teeth for each
dental model. Regarding the challenge when only weak annotation is provided, we
present a dental arch prior-assisted 3D tooth segmentation method, namely
DArch. Our DArch consists of two stages, including tooth centroid detection and
tooth instance segmentation. Accurately detecting the tooth centroids can help
locate the individual tooth, thus benefiting the segmentation. Thus, our DArch
proposes to leverage the dental arch prior to assist the detection.
Specifically, we firstly propose a coarse-to-fine method to estimate the dental
arch, in which the dental arch is initially generated by Bezier curve
regression, and then a graph-based convolutional network (GCN) is trained to
refine it. With the estimated dental arch, we then propose a novel Arch-aware
Point Sampling (APS) method to assist the tooth centroid proposal generation.
Meantime, a segmentor is independently trained using a patch-based training
strategy, aiming to segment a tooth instance from a 3D patch centered at the
tooth centroid. Experimental results on $4,773$ dental models have shown our
DArch can accurately segment each tooth of a dental model, and its performance

Haptic bilateral teleoperation system for free-hand dental procedures,"Lorenzo Pagliara, Enrico Ferrentino, Andrea Chiacchio, Giovanni Russo","Free-hand dental procedures are typically repetitive, time-consuming and
require high precision and manual dexterity. Dental robots can play a key role
in improving procedural accuracy and safety, enhancing patient comfort, and
reducing operator workload. However, robotic solutions for free-hand procedures
remain limited or completely lacking, and their acceptance is still low. To
address this gap, we develop a haptic bilateral teleoperation system (HBTS) for
free-hand dental procedures. The system includes a dedicated mechanical
end-effector, compatible with standard clinical tools, and equipped with an
endoscopic camera for improved visibility of the intervention site. By ensuring
motion and force correspondence between the operator's actions and the robot's
movements, monitored through visual feedback, we enhance the operator's sensory
awareness and motor accuracy. Furthermore, recognizing the need to ensure
procedural safety, we limit interaction forces by scaling the motion references
provided to the admittance controller based solely on measured contact forces.
This ensures effective force limitation in all contact states without requiring
prior knowledge of the environment. The proposed HBTS is validated in a dental
scaling procedure using a dental phantom. The results show that the system

identification and is crucial for preventing oral diseases. The performance of
deep learning models depends on high-quality data and requires substantial
training resources, making efficient deployment challenging. Core data
selection, by eliminating low-quality and confusing data, aims to enhance
training efficiency without significantly compromising model performance.
However, distance-based data selection methods struggle to distinguish
dependencies among high-dimensional caries data. To address this issue, we
propose a Core Data Selection Method with Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSCDS) for
efficient caries image learning and caries classification. We describe the core
data selection criterion as the distribution of samples in different classes.
JSCDS calculates the cluster centers by sample embedding representation in the
caries classification network and utilizes Jensen-Shannon Divergence to compute
the mutual information between data samples and cluster centers, capturing
nonlinear dependencies among high-dimensional data. The average mutual
information is calculated to fit the above distribution, serving as the
criterion for constructing the core set for model training. Extensive
experiments on RGB caries datasets show that JSCDS outperforms other data
selection methods in prediction performance and time consumption. Notably,
JSCDS exceeds the performance of the full dataset model with only 50% of the

"Accurate 3D Prediction of Missing Teeth in Diverse Patterns for Precise
  Dental Implant Planning","Lei Ma, Peng Xue, Yuning Gu, Yue Zhao, Min Zhu, Zhongxiang Ding, Dinggang Shen","In recent years, the demand for dental implants has surged, driven by their
high success rates and esthetic advantages. However, accurate prediction of
missing teeth for precise digital implant planning remains a challenge due to
the intricate nature of dental structures and the variability in tooth loss
patterns. This study presents a novel framework for accurate prediction of
missing teeth in different patterns, facilitating digital implant planning. The
proposed framework begins by estimating point-to-point correspondence among a
dataset of dental mesh models reconstructed from CBCT images of healthy
subjects. Subsequently, tooth dictionaries are constructed for each tooth type,
encoding their position and shape information based on the established
point-to-point correspondence. To predict missing teeth in a given dental mesh
model, sparse coefficients are learned by sparsely representing adjacent teeth
of the missing teeth using the corresponding tooth dictionaries. These
coefficients are then applied to the dictionaries of the missing teeth to
generate accurate predictions of their positions and shapes. The evaluation
results on real subjects shows that our proposed framework achieves an average
prediction error of 1.04mm for predictions of single missing tooth and an
average prediction error of 1.33mm for the prediction of 14 missing teeth,
which demonstrates its capability of accurately predicting missing teeth in
various patterns. By accurately predicting missing teeth, dental professionals
can improve the planning and placement of dental implants, leading to better

"Masked Latent Transformer with the Random Masking Ratio to Advance the
  Diagnosis of Dental Fluorosis","Yun Wu, Hao Xu, Maohua Gu, Zhongchuan Jiang, Jun Xu, Youliang Tian","Dental fluorosis is a chronic disease caused by long-term overconsumption of
fluoride, which leads to changes in the appearance of tooth enamel. It is an
important basis for early non-invasive diagnosis of endemic fluorosis. However,
even dental professionals may not be able to accurately distinguish dental
fluorosis and its severity based on tooth images. Currently, there is still a
gap in research on applying deep learning to diagnosing dental fluorosis.
Therefore, we construct the first open-source dental fluorosis image dataset
(DFID), laying the foundation for deep learning research in this field. To
advance the diagnosis of dental fluorosis, we propose a pioneering deep
learning model called masked latent transformer with the random masking ratio
(MLTrMR). MLTrMR introduces a mask latent modeling scheme based on Vision
Transformer to enhance contextual learning of dental fluorosis lesion
characteristics. Consisting of a latent embedder, encoder, and decoder, MLTrMR
employs the latent embedder to extract latent tokens from the original image,
whereas the encoder and decoder comprising the latent transformer (LT) block
are used to process unmasked tokens and predict masked tokens, respectively. To
mitigate the lack of inductive bias in Vision Transformer, which may result in
performance degradation, the LT block introduces latent tokens to enhance the
learning capacity of latent lesion features. Furthermore, we design an
auxiliary loss function to constrain the parameter update direction of the
model. MLTrMR achieves 80.19% accuracy, 75.79% F1, and 81.28% quadratic

that integrates an M-Net-like structure with Swin Transformers and a novel
component named Teeth Attention Block (TAB). Existing teeth image segmentation
methods have issues with less accurate and unreliable segmentation outcomes due
to the complex and varying morphology of teeth, although teeth segmentation in
dental panoramic images is essential for dental disease diagnosis. We propose a
novel teeth segmentation model incorporating an M-Net-like structure with Swin

that focuses specifically on the complex structures of teeth. The attention
mechanism in TAB precisely highlights key elements of teeth features in

Furthermore, we employ a multiscale supervision strategy, which leverages the
left and right legs of the U-Net structure, boosting the performance of the
segmentation with enhanced feature representation. The squared Dice loss is
utilized to tackle the class imbalance issue, ensuring accurate segmentation

"Bayesian Nonparametric Policy Search with Application to Periodontal
  Recall Intervals","Qian Guan, Brian J. Reich, Eric B. Laber, Dipankar Bandyopadhyay","Tooth loss from periodontal disease is a major public health burden in the
United States. Standard clinical practice is to recommend a dental visit every
six months; however, this practice is not evidence-based, and poor dental
outcomes and increasing dental insurance premiums indicate room for
improvement. We consider a tailored approach that recommends recall time based
on patient characteristics and medical history to minimize disease progression
without increasing resource expenditures. We formalize this method as a dynamic
treatment regime which comprises a sequence of decisions, one per stage of
intervention, that follow a decision rule which maps current patient
information to a recommendation for their next visit time. The dynamics of
periodontal health, visit frequency, and patient compliance are complex, yet
the estimated optimal regime must be interpretable to domain experts if it is
to be integrated into clinical practice. We combine non-parametric Bayesian
dynamics modeling with policy-search algorithms to estimate the optimal dynamic
treatment regime within an interpretable class of regimes. Both simulation
experiments and application to a rich database of electronic dental records
from the HealthPartners HMO shows that our proposed method leads to better
dental health without increasing the average recommended recall time relative
to competing methods.",2018-10-10T02:32:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04338v1,dental caries
"A convolutional neural network for teeth margin detection on
  3-dimensional dental meshes","Hu Chen, Hong Li, Bifu Hu, Kenan Ma, Yuchun Sun","We proposed a convolutional neural network for vertex classification on
3-dimensional dental meshes, and used it to detect teeth margins. An expanding
layer was constructed to collect statistic values of neighbor vertex features
and compute new features for each vertex with convolutional neural networks. An
end-to-end neural network was proposed to take vertex features, including
coordinates, curvatures and distance, as input and output each vertex
classification label. Several network structures with different parameters of
expanding layers and a base line network without expanding layers were designed
and trained by 1156 dental meshes. The accuracy, recall and precision were
validated on 145 dental meshes to rate the best network structures, which were
finally tested on another 144 dental meshes. All networks with our expanding
layers performed better than baseline, and the best one achieved an accuracy of
0.877 both on validation dataset and test dataset.",2021-07-07T06:16:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03030v1,dental caries
"Developing a Novel Approach for Periapical Dental Radiographs
  Segmentation","Elaheh Hatamimajoumerd, Farshad Tajeripour","Image processing techniques has been widely used in dental researches such as
human identification and forensic dentistry, teeth numbering, dental carries
detection and periodontal disease analysis. One of the most challenging parts
in dental imaging is teeth segmentation and how to separate them from each
other. In this paper, an automated method for teeth segmentation of Periapical
dental x-ray images which contain at least one root-canalled tooth is proposed.
The result of this approach can be used as an initial step in bone lesion
detection. The proposed algorithm is made of two stages. The first stage is
pre-processing. The second and main part of this algorithm calculated rotation
degree and uses the integral projection method for tooth isolation.
Experimental results show that this algorithm is robust and achieves high
accuracy.",2021-11-13T17:25:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07156v2,dental caries
"CTooth+: A Large-scale Dental Cone Beam Computed Tomography Dataset and
  Benchmark for Tooth Volume Segmentation","Weiwei Cui, Yaqi Wang, Yilong Li, Dan Song, Xingyong Zuo, Jiaojiao Wang, Yifan Zhang, Huiyu Zhou, Bung san Chong, Liaoyuan Zeng, Qianni Zhang","Accurate tooth volume segmentation is a prerequisite for computer-aided
dental analysis. Deep learning-based tooth segmentation methods have achieved
satisfying performances but require a large quantity of tooth data with ground
truth. The dental data publicly available is limited meaning the existing
methods can not be reproduced, evaluated and applied in clinical practice. In
this paper, we establish a 3D dental CBCT dataset CTooth+, with 22 fully
annotated volumes and 146 unlabeled volumes. We further evaluate several
state-of-the-art tooth volume segmentation strategies based on fully-supervised
learning, semi-supervised learning and active learning, and define the
performance principles. This work provides a new benchmark for the tooth volume
segmentation task, and the experiment can serve as the baseline for future
AI-based dental imaging research and clinical application development.",2022-08-02T09:13:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01643v1,dental caries
