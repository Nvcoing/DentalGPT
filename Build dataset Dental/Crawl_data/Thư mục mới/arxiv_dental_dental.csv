"Construction of unbiased dental template and parametric dental model for
  precision digital dentistry","Lei Ma, Jingyang Zhang, Ke Deng, Peng Xue, Zhiming Cui, Yu Fang, Minhui Tang, Yue Zhao, Min Zhu, Zhongxiang Ding, Dinggang Shen","Dental template and parametric dental models are important tools for various
applications in digital dentistry. However, constructing an unbiased dental
template and accurate parametric dental models remains a challenging task due
to the complex anatomical and morphological dental structures and also low
volume ratio of the teeth. In this study, we develop an unbiased dental
template by constructing an accurate dental atlas from CBCT images with
guidance of teeth segmentation. First, to address the challenges, we propose to
enhance the CBCT images and their segmentation images, including image
cropping, image masking and segmentation intensity reassigning. Then, we
further use the segmentation images to perform co-registration with the CBCT
images to generate an accurate dental atlas, from which an unbiased dental
template can be generated. By leveraging the unbiased dental template, we
construct parametric dental models by estimating point-to-point correspondences
between the dental models and employing Principal Component Analysis to
determine shape subspaces of the parametric dental models. A total of 159 CBCT
images of real subjects are collected to perform the constructions.
Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of our proposed method in
constructing unbiased dental template and parametric dental model. The
developed dental template and parametric dental models are available at

ToMoBrush: Exploring Dental Health Sensing using a Sonic Toothbrush,"Kuang Yuan, Mohamed Ibrahim, Yiwen Song, Guoxiang Deng, Suvendra Vijayan, Robert Nerone, Akshay Gadre, Swarun Kumar","Early detection of dental disease is crucial to prevent adverse outcomes.
Today, dental X-rays are currently the most accurate gold standard for dental
disease detection. Unfortunately, regular X-ray exam is still a privilege for
billions of people around the world. In this paper, we ask: ""Can we develop a
low-cost sensing system that enables dental self-examination in the comfort of
one's home?""
  This paper presents ToMoBrush, a dental health sensing system that explores
using off-the-shelf sonic toothbrushes for dental condition detection. Our
solution leverages the fact that a sonic toothbrush produces rich acoustic
signals when in contact with teeth, which contain important information about
each tooth's status. ToMoBrush extracts tooth resonance signatures from the
acoustic signals to characterize varied dental health conditions of the teeth.
We evaluate ToMoBrush on 19 participants and dental-standard models for
detecting common dental problems including caries, calculus, and food
impaction, achieving a detection ROC-AUC of 0.90, 0.83, and 0.88 respectively.

"Semantic decomposition Network with Contrastive and Structural
  Constraints for Dental Plaque Segmentation","Jian Shi, Baoli Sun, Xinchen Ye, Zhihui Wang, Xiaolong Luo, Jin Liu, Heli Gao, Haojie Li","Segmenting dental plaque from images of medical reagent staining provides
valuable information for diagnosis and the determination of follow-up treatment
plan. However, accurate dental plaque segmentation is a challenging task that
requires identifying teeth and dental plaque subjected to semantic-blur regions
(i.e., confused boundaries in border regions between teeth and dental plaque)
and complex variations of instance shapes, which are not fully addressed by
existing methods. Therefore, we propose a semantic decomposition network
(SDNet) that introduces two single-task branches to separately address the
segmentation of teeth and dental plaque and designs additional constraints to
learn category-specific features for each branch, thus facilitating the
semantic decomposition and improving the performance of dental plaque
segmentation. Specifically, SDNet learns two separate segmentation branches for
teeth and dental plaque in a divide-and-conquer manner to decouple the
entangled relation between them. Each branch that specifies a category tends to
yield accurate segmentation. To help these two branches better focus on
category-specific features, two constraint modules are further proposed: 1)
contrastive constraint module (CCM) to learn discriminative feature
representations by maximizing the distance between different category
representations, so as to reduce the negative impact of semantic-blur regions
on feature extraction; 2) structural constraint module (SCM) to provide
complete structural information for dental plaque of various shapes by the
supervision of an boundary-aware geometric constraint. Besides, we construct a
large-scale open-source Stained Dental Plaque Segmentation dataset (SDPSeg),
which provides high-quality annotations for teeth and dental plaque.
Experimental results on SDPSeg datasets show SDNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance.",2022-08-12T14:10:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06283v1,dental
"Generative Adversarial Networks for Dental Patient Identity Protection
  in Orthodontic Educational Imaging","Mingchuan Tian, Wilson Weixun Lu, Kelvin Weng Chiong Foong, Eugene Loh","Objectives: This research introduces a novel area-preserving Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) inversion technique for effectively de-identifying
dental patient images. This innovative method addresses privacy concerns while
preserving key dental features, thereby generating valuable resources for
dental education and research.
  Methods: We enhanced the existing GAN Inversion methodology to maximize the
preservation of dental characteristics within the synthesized images. A
comprehensive technical framework incorporating several deep learning models
was developed to provide end-to-end development guidance and practical
application for image de-identification.
  Results: Our approach was assessed with varied facial pictures, extensively
used for diagnosing skeletal asymmetry and facial anomalies. Results
demonstrated our model's ability to adapt the context from one image to
another, maintaining compatibility, while preserving dental features essential
for oral diagnosis and dental education. A panel of five clinicians conducted
an evaluation on a set of original and GAN-processed images. The generated
images achieved effective de-identification, maintaining the realism of
important dental features and were deemed useful for dental diagnostics and
education.
  Clinical Significance: Our GAN model and the encompassing framework can
streamline the de-identification process of dental patient images, enhancing
efficiency in dental education. This method improves students' diagnostic

DArch: Dental Arch Prior-assisted 3D Tooth Instance Segmentation,"Liangdong Qiu, Chongjie Ye, Pei Chen, Yunbi Liu, Xiaoguang Han, Shuguang Cui","Automatic tooth instance segmentation on 3D dental models is a fundamental
task for computer-aided orthodontic treatments. Existing learning-based methods
rely heavily on expensive point-wise annotations. To alleviate this problem, we
are the first to explore a low-cost annotation way for 3D tooth instance
segmentation, i.e., labeling all tooth centroids and only a few teeth for each
dental model. Regarding the challenge when only weak annotation is provided, we
present a dental arch prior-assisted 3D tooth segmentation method, namely
DArch. Our DArch consists of two stages, including tooth centroid detection and
tooth instance segmentation. Accurately detecting the tooth centroids can help
locate the individual tooth, thus benefiting the segmentation. Thus, our DArch
proposes to leverage the dental arch prior to assist the detection.
Specifically, we firstly propose a coarse-to-fine method to estimate the dental
arch, in which the dental arch is initially generated by Bezier curve
regression, and then a graph-based convolutional network (GCN) is trained to
refine it. With the estimated dental arch, we then propose a novel Arch-aware
Point Sampling (APS) method to assist the tooth centroid proposal generation.
Meantime, a segmentor is independently trained using a patch-based training
strategy, aiming to segment a tooth instance from a 3D patch centered at the
tooth centroid. Experimental results on $4,773$ dental models have shown our
DArch can accurately segment each tooth of a dental model, and its performance
is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.",2022-04-25T18:30:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11911v1,dental
"Design of quantum correlation based automatic focus detection system
  during dental laser operation","Binh Xuan Cao, Duc An Pham","Dental laser has been developed recently and gradually replaced the
conventional dental treatment methods, especially in dental caries removal. The
utility of laser in dentistry contributes to reduce the pain during surgery and

beneficial properties such as excellent directionality, high speed, ultra-tiny
active area and tunable energy concentration, laser is still quite limited in
dental surgery because of the difficulty in real-time high precision detection
of laser focus during the operation. In this study, a cutting-edge optical
system for real-time focus detection during dental laser operation employing
the quantum entanglement of photon pairs created via spontaneous parametric
downconversion (SPDC) is presented. Defocusing distance of the specimen which
is used as the sample tooth can be determined precisely through spatial
correlation of photons arriving at the detectors. The proposed technique can be

Haptic bilateral teleoperation system for free-hand dental procedures,"Lorenzo Pagliara, Enrico Ferrentino, Andrea Chiacchio, Giovanni Russo","Free-hand dental procedures are typically repetitive, time-consuming and
require high precision and manual dexterity. Dental robots can play a key role
in improving procedural accuracy and safety, enhancing patient comfort, and
reducing operator workload. However, robotic solutions for free-hand procedures
remain limited or completely lacking, and their acceptance is still low. To
address this gap, we develop a haptic bilateral teleoperation system (HBTS) for
free-hand dental procedures. The system includes a dedicated mechanical
end-effector, compatible with standard clinical tools, and equipped with an
endoscopic camera for improved visibility of the intervention site. By ensuring
motion and force correspondence between the operator's actions and the robot's
movements, monitored through visual feedback, we enhance the operator's sensory
awareness and motor accuracy. Furthermore, recognizing the need to ensure
procedural safety, we limit interaction forces by scaling the motion references
provided to the admittance controller based solely on measured contact forces.
This ensures effective force limitation in all contact states without requiring
prior knowledge of the environment. The proposed HBTS is validated in a dental
scaling procedure using a dental phantom. The results show that the system
improves the naturalness, safety, and accuracy of teleoperation, highlighting
its potential to enhance free-hand dental procedures.",2025-03-27T09:11:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21288v1,dental

"Accurate 3D Prediction of Missing Teeth in Diverse Patterns for Precise
  Dental Implant Planning","Lei Ma, Peng Xue, Yuning Gu, Yue Zhao, Min Zhu, Zhongxiang Ding, Dinggang Shen","In recent years, the demand for dental implants has surged, driven by their
high success rates and esthetic advantages. However, accurate prediction of
missing teeth for precise digital implant planning remains a challenge due to
the intricate nature of dental structures and the variability in tooth loss
patterns. This study presents a novel framework for accurate prediction of
missing teeth in different patterns, facilitating digital implant planning. The
proposed framework begins by estimating point-to-point correspondence among a
dataset of dental mesh models reconstructed from CBCT images of healthy
subjects. Subsequently, tooth dictionaries are constructed for each tooth type,
encoding their position and shape information based on the established
point-to-point correspondence. To predict missing teeth in a given dental mesh
model, sparse coefficients are learned by sparsely representing adjacent teeth
of the missing teeth using the corresponding tooth dictionaries. These
coefficients are then applied to the dictionaries of the missing teeth to
generate accurate predictions of their positions and shapes. The evaluation
results on real subjects shows that our proposed framework achieves an average
prediction error of 1.04mm for predictions of single missing tooth and an
average prediction error of 1.33mm for the prediction of 14 missing teeth,
which demonstrates its capability of accurately predicting missing teeth in
various patterns. By accurately predicting missing teeth, dental professionals
can improve the planning and placement of dental implants, leading to better
esthetic and functional outcomes for patients undergoing dental implant
procedures.",2023-07-16T05:52:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07953v1,dental
"Masked Latent Transformer with the Random Masking Ratio to Advance the
  Diagnosis of Dental Fluorosis","Yun Wu, Hao Xu, Maohua Gu, Zhongchuan Jiang, Jun Xu, Youliang Tian","Dental fluorosis is a chronic disease caused by long-term overconsumption of
fluoride, which leads to changes in the appearance of tooth enamel. It is an
important basis for early non-invasive diagnosis of endemic fluorosis. However,
even dental professionals may not be able to accurately distinguish dental
fluorosis and its severity based on tooth images. Currently, there is still a
gap in research on applying deep learning to diagnosing dental fluorosis.
Therefore, we construct the first open-source dental fluorosis image dataset
(DFID), laying the foundation for deep learning research in this field. To
advance the diagnosis of dental fluorosis, we propose a pioneering deep
learning model called masked latent transformer with the random masking ratio
(MLTrMR). MLTrMR introduces a mask latent modeling scheme based on Vision
Transformer to enhance contextual learning of dental fluorosis lesion
characteristics. Consisting of a latent embedder, encoder, and decoder, MLTrMR
employs the latent embedder to extract latent tokens from the original image,
whereas the encoder and decoder comprising the latent transformer (LT) block
are used to process unmasked tokens and predict masked tokens, respectively. To
mitigate the lack of inductive bias in Vision Transformer, which may result in
performance degradation, the LT block introduces latent tokens to enhance the
learning capacity of latent lesion features. Furthermore, we design an
auxiliary loss function to constrain the parameter update direction of the
model. MLTrMR achieves 80.19% accuracy, 75.79% F1, and 81.28% quadratic

methods have issues with less accurate and unreliable segmentation outcomes due

dental panoramic images is essential for dental disease diagnosis. We propose a
novel teeth segmentation model incorporating an M-Net-like structure with Swin

that focuses specifically on the complex structures of teeth. The attention
mechanism in TAB precisely highlights key elements of teeth features in

Furthermore, we employ a multiscale supervision strategy, which leverages the

segmentation with enhanced feature representation. The squared Dice loss is
utilized to tackle the class imbalance issue, ensuring accurate segmentation
across all classes. The proposed method was validated on a panoramic teeth

  Segmentation","Elaheh Hatamimajoumerd, Farshad Tajeripour","Image processing techniques has been widely used in dental researches such as
human identification and forensic dentistry, teeth numbering, dental carries

The result of this approach can be used as an initial step in bone lesion

"Lack of corundum, carbon residues and revealing gaps on dental implants","Guy Florian Draenert, Gergo Mitov","Surface modification is an important topic to improve dental implants.
Corundum residues, which are part of current dental implant blasting,
disappeared on Straumann dental implants in recent publications. In our

electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) we
found the following three main findings: surfaces are nearly corundum-free,
disseminated gap-framed corundum particles and significant molecular carbon
residues. The data strongly suggest that Straumann applies a modified surface
technology on dental implants to remove corundum residues and involving unclear
carbons. One explanation could be, a Straumann patent involving a dextran

Environmental Influence on Dental Morphology,"Alessandro Riga, Maria Giovanna Belcastro, Jacopo Moggi-Cecchi","Development is a complex phenomenon where the forming phenotype interacts
with genetic and environmental inputs. Teeth are an important model for
developmental studies and their development has been thoroughly investigated.
However, despite of a large literature on the genetics of dental development,
no studies have focused yet on the environmental influences on dental
morphology. Here, we aim to test whether and to what extent the environment
plays a role in producing morphological variation in human teeth. We selected a
sample of modern human skulls and we used dental enamel hypoplasia as an
environmental stress marker in order to identify two groups with different
stress level, referred to as SG (""stressed"" group) and NSG (""non-stressed""
group). We collected data on the occurrence and the relative development of 15
morphological traits (5 for each molar) on upper molars using a standard
methodology commonly used in dental anthropology (ASU-DAS system) and then we
compared the frequencies of the traits in the two groups. Overall, the results
suggest that: (i) stressors like malnutrition and/or systemic diseases have a
significant effect on upper molar morphology; (ii) stress generates a
developmental response which increases the morphological variability of the SG;
(iii) the increase of variability is directional, since individuals belonging
to the SG have increased cusps dimensions and number. These results are
consistent with the expectations of the morphodynamic model of dental
development (Jernvall, 1995).",2013-01-30T19:20:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7334v2,dental

However, it provides limited 2D information compared with cone-beam computed

the oral cavity but with more radiation dose and a higher price. Consequently,
it is of great interest to reconstruct the 3D structure from a 2D X-ray image,
which can greatly explore the application of X-ray imaging in dental surgeries.
In this paper, we propose a framework, named Oral-3D, to reconstruct the 3D
oral cavity from a single PX image and prior information of the dental arch.
Specifically, we first train a generative model to learn the cross-dimension
transformation from 2D to 3D. Then we restore the shape of the oral cavity with
a deformation module with the dental arch curve, which can be obtained simply
by taking a photo of the patient's mouth. To be noted, Oral-3D can restore both

diagnosis system to detect dental caries in Panoramic images for the first
time, to the best of authors' knowledge. The proposed model benefits from
various pretrained deep learning models through transfer learning to extract
relevant features from x-rays and uses a capsule network to draw prediction
results. On a dataset of 470 Panoramic images used for features extraction,

Dental pathology detection in 3D cone-beam CT,"Adel Zakirov, Matvey Ezhov, Maxim Gusarev, Vladimir Alexandrovsky, Evgeny Shumilov","Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a valuable imaging method in dental
diagnostics that provides information not available in traditional 2D imaging.
However, interpretation of CBCT images is a time-consuming process that
requires a physician to work with complicated software. In this work we propose
an automated pipeline composed of several deep convolutional neural networks
and algorithmic heuristics. Our task is two-fold: a) find locations of each
present tooth inside a 3D image volume, and b) detect several common tooth
conditions in each tooth. The proposed system achieves 96.3\% accuracy in tooth
localization and an average of 0.94 AUROC for 6 common tooth conditions.",2018-10-24T12:04:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10309v1,dental
"A smile I could recognise in a thousand: Automatic identification of
  identity from dental radiography","Oscar de Felice, Gustavo de Felice","In this paper, we present a method to automatically compare multiple
radiographs in order to find the identity of a patient out of the dental
features. The method is based on the matching of image features, previously
extracted by computer vision algorithms for image descriptor recognition. The
principal application (being also our motivation to study the problem) of such
a method would be in victim identification in mass disasters.",2020-01-14T19:02:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05006v1,dental
