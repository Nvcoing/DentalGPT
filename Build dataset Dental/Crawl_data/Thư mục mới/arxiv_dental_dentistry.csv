"AI Techniques for Cone Beam Computed Tomography in Dentistry: Trends and
  Practices","Saba Sarwar, Suraiya Jabin","Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a popular imaging modality in
dentistry for diagnosing and planning treatment for a variety of oral diseases
with the ability to produce detailed, three-dimensional images of the teeth,
jawbones, and surrounding structures. CBCT imaging has emerged as an essential
diagnostic tool in dentistry. CBCT imaging has seen significant improvements in
terms of its diagnostic value, as well as its accuracy and efficiency, with the
most recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This paper
reviews recent AI trends and practices in dental CBCT imaging. AI has been used
for lesion detection, malocclusion classification, measurement of buccal bone
thickness, and classification and segmentation of teeth, alveolar bones,
mandibles, landmarks, contours, and pharyngeal airways using CBCT images.
Mainly machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms, and
super-resolution techniques are used for these tasks. This review focuses on
the potential of AI techniques to transform CBCT imaging in dentistry, which
would improve both diagnosis and treatment planning. Finally, we discuss the
challenges and limitations of artificial intelligence in dentistry and CBCT
imaging.",2023-06-05T16:45:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03025v2,dentistry

  Multi-Modal Large Language Model","Hanyao Huang, Ou Zheng, Dongdong Wang, Jiayi Yin, Zijin Wang, Shengxuan Ding, Heng Yin, Chuan Xu, Renjie Yang, Qian Zheng, Bing Shi","The ChatGPT, a lite and conversational variant of Generative Pretrained
Transformer 4 (GPT-4) developed by OpenAI, is one of the milestone Large
Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. LLMs have stirred up much
interest among researchers and practitioners in their impressive skills in
natural language processing tasks, which profoundly impact various fields. This
paper mainly discusses the future applications of LLMs in dentistry. We
introduce two primary LLM deployment methods in dentistry, including automated
dental diagnosis and cross-modal dental diagnosis, and examine their potential
applications. Especially, equipped with a cross-modal encoder, a single LLM can
manage multi-source data and conduct advanced natural language reasoning to
perform complex clinical operations. We also present cases to demonstrate the
potential of a fully automatic Multi-Modal LLM AI system for dentistry clinical
application. While LLMs offer significant potential benefits, the challenges,
such as data privacy, data quality, and model bias, need further study.

Cone-beam CT for Dental Radiography,"Kaspar Höschel, Janos Juhasz","The cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) technique was first inserted in
dental imaging 15 years ago. Due to this technique 3D imaging in dentistry has
been excessively changed. The purpose beyond using CBCT instead of computed
tomography (CT) imaging is that CT can not be used in many cases in dentistry,
in addition to the higher radiation and cost of CT. Nowadays, CBCT can be
applied in diagnostics for several dental specialties because of the variety of
services it offers and the specification of use. In contrast to CT, CBCT has
shown great benefits in endodontics, implant planning oral and maxillofacial

"Virtual Alignment Method and its application to the dental prostheses

alignment method (VAM) allowed a more accurate method to remove the possible
errors that limit the resolution and clarity of the reconstructed image. In the
field of dentistry, the movement of patients during the scanning poses as one
of the major factors hindering the final reconstructed image quality. Here, the
patient's movement was artificially given to the projection image set and the
newly proposed algorithm using the sinogram and the fixed point was applied to
the tooth sample to compare the reconstruction image to the actual projection
image set. The new alignment method showed promising results by reducing the
margin of errors down to a few micrometer, which will allow the production of
high-quality dental prostheses with accuracy and precision. We hope that the

"Construction of unbiased dental template and parametric dental model for
  precision digital dentistry","Lei Ma, Jingyang Zhang, Ke Deng, Peng Xue, Zhiming Cui, Yu Fang, Minhui Tang, Yue Zhao, Min Zhu, Zhongxiang Ding, Dinggang Shen","Dental template and parametric dental models are important tools for various
applications in digital dentistry. However, constructing an unbiased dental
template and accurate parametric dental models remains a challenging task due
to the complex anatomical and morphological dental structures and also low
volume ratio of the teeth. In this study, we develop an unbiased dental
template by constructing an accurate dental atlas from CBCT images with
guidance of teeth segmentation. First, to address the challenges, we propose to
enhance the CBCT images and their segmentation images, including image
cropping, image masking and segmentation intensity reassigning. Then, we
further use the segmentation images to perform co-registration with the CBCT
images to generate an accurate dental atlas, from which an unbiased dental
template can be generated. By leveraging the unbiased dental template, we
construct parametric dental models by estimating point-to-point correspondences
between the dental models and employing Principal Component Analysis to
determine shape subspaces of the parametric dental models. A total of 159 CBCT

"H-FCBFormer Hierarchical Fully Convolutional Branch Transformer for
  Occlusal Contact Segmentation with Articulating Paper","Ryan Banks, Bernat Rovira-Lastra, Jordi Martinez-Gomis, Akhilanand Chaurasia, Yunpeng Li","Occlusal contacts are the locations at which the occluding surfaces of the
maxilla and the mandible posterior teeth meet. Occlusal contact detection is a
vital tool for restoring the loss of masticatory function and is a mandatory
assessment in the field of dentistry, with particular importance in
prosthodontics and restorative dentistry. The most common method for occlusal
contact detection is articulating paper. However, this method can indicate

  Approach","Haider Raza, Mohsin Ali, Vishal Krishna Singh, Agustin Wahjuningrum, Rachel Sarig, Akhilanand Chaurasia","Precise identification and detection of the Mental Foramen are crucial in
dentistry, impacting procedures such as impacted tooth removal, cyst surgeries,

post-surgery issues and improves patient outcomes. Moreover, this study aims to
accelerate dental procedures, elevating patient care and healthcare efficiency
in dentistry. This research used Deep Learning methods to accurately detect and
segment the Mental Foramen from panoramic radiograph images. Two mask types,
circular and square, were used during model training. Multiple segmentation
models were employed to identify and segment the Mental Foramen, and their
effectiveness was evaluated using diverse metrics. An in-house dataset
comprising 1000 panoramic radiographs was created for this study. Our
experiments demonstrated that the Classical UNet model performed exceptionally
well on the test data, achieving a Dice Coefficient of 0.79 and an Intersection
over Union (IoU) of 0.67. Moreover, ResUNet++ and UNet Attention models showed
competitive performance, with Dice scores of 0.675 and 0.676, and IoU values of

with varied backbone architectures, finding LinkNet to produce the best
outcomes. In conclusion, our research highlights the efficacy of the classical
Unet model in accurately identifying and outlining the Mental Foramen in
panoramic radiographs. While vital, this task is comparatively simpler than

"PX2Tooth: Reconstructing the 3D Point Cloud Teeth from a Single
  Panoramic X-ray","Wen Ma, Huikai Wu, Zikai Xiao, Yang Feng, Jian Wu, Zuozhu Liu","Reconstructing the 3D anatomical structures of the oral cavity, which
originally reside in the cone-beam CT (CBCT), from a single 2D Panoramic
X-ray(PX) remains a critical yet challenging task, as it can effectively reduce
radiation risks and treatment costs during the diagnostic in digital dentistry.
However, current methods are either error-prone or only trained/evaluated on
small-scale datasets (less than 50 cases), resulting in compromised
trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose PX2Tooth, a novel approach to
reconstruct 3D teeth using a single PX image with a two-stage framework. First,
we design the PXSegNet to segment the permanent teeth from the PX images,
providing clear positional, morphological, and categorical information for each
tooth. Subsequently, we design a novel tooth generation network (TGNet) that
learns to transform random point clouds into 3D teeth. TGNet integrates the
segmented patch information and introduces a Prior Fusion Module (PFM) to
enhance the generation quality, especially in the root apex region. Moreover,
we construct a dataset comprising 499 pairs of CBCT and Panoramic X-rays.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PX2Tooth can achieve an Intersection
over Union (IoU) of 0.793, significantly surpassing previous methods,

  restorations: Rolled versus cut threads","Mikel Armentia, Mikel Abasolo, Ibai Coria, Joseba Albizuri, Josu Aguirrebeitia","Statement of problem. Cold rolling is widely used for screw thread
manufacturing in industry but is less common in implant dentistry, where
cutting is the preferred manufacturing method. Purpose. The purpose of this in
vitro study was to compare the surface finish and mechanical performance of a
specific model of prosthetic screw used for direct restorations manufactured by
thread rolling and cutting. Material and methods. The thread profiles were
measured in an optical measuring machine, the residual stresses in an X-ray
diffractometer, the surface finish in a scanning electron microscope, and then
fatigue and static load tests were carried out in a direct stress test bench
according to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14801.
Finally, linear regression models and 95% interval confidence bands were
calculated and compared through ANCOVA for fatigue tests while the t test was
used for statistical comparisons (a=.05). Results. The surface finish was
smoother, and compressive residual stresses were higher for the roll-threaded
screws. Linear regression models showed a fatigue life 9 times higher for
roll-threaded screws (P=1) without affecting static behavior, which showed
statistically similar static strengths (P=.54). However, the thread profile in
the roll-threaded screws was not accurately reproduced, but this should be
easily corrected in future prototypes. Conclusions. Rolling was demonstrated to

large labeled data sets. These data sets are precious yet scarce because of the
time-consuming labeling procedures, discouraging researchers from producing
them. This scarcity is especially true in dentistry, where deep learning
applications are still in an embryonic stage. Motivated by this background, we
address in this study the construction of a public data set of dental panoramic
radiographs. Our objects of interest are the teeth, which are segmented and
numbered, as they are the primary targets for dentists when screening a
panoramic radiograph. We benefited from the human-in-the-loop (HITL) concept to
expedite the labeling procedure, using predictions from deep neural networks as
provisional labels, later verified by human annotators. All the gathering and
labeling procedures of this novel data set is thoroughly analyzed. The results
were consistent and behaved as expected: At each HITL iteration, the model
predictions improved. Our results demonstrated a 51% labeling time reduction
using HITL, saving us more than 390 continuous working hours. In a novel online
platform, called OdontoAI, created to work as task central for this novel data
set, we released 4,000 images, from which 2,000 have their labels publicly
available for model fitting. The labels of the other 2,000 images are private

Nevertheless, designing automated algorithms for this purpose poses significant
challenges, mainly due to the scarcity of annotated data and variations in

"Robust frequency-dependent diffusion kurtosis computation using an
  efficient direction scheme, axisymmetric modelling, and spatial
  regularization","J. Hamilton, K. Xu, A. Brown, C. A. Baron","Frequency-dependent diffusion MRI (dMRI) using oscillating gradient encoding
and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) techniques have been shown to provide
additional insight into tissue microstructure compared to conventional dMRI.
However, a technical challenge when combining these techniques is that the
generation of the large b-values required for DKI is difficult when using
oscillating gradient diffusion encoding. While efficient encoding schemes can
enable larger b-values by maximizing multiple gradient channels simultaneously,
they do not have sufficient directions to enable fitting of the full kurtosis
tensor. Accordingly, we investigate a DKI fitting algorithm that combines
axisymmetric DKI fitting, a prior that enforces the same axis of symmetry for
all oscillating gradient frequencies, and spatial regularization, which
together enable robust DKI fitting for a 10-direction scheme that offers double
the b-value compared to traditional direction schemes. Using data from mice
(oscillating frequencies of 0, 60, and 120 Hz) and humans (0 Hz only), we first
show that axisymmetric modelling is advantageous over full kurtosis tensor
fitting in terms of preserving contrast and reducing noise in DKI maps, and
improved DKI map quality when using an efficient encoding scheme with averaging
as compared to a traditional scheme with more encoding directions. We also
demonstrate how spatial regularization during fitting preserves spatial
features better than using Gaussian filtering prior to fitting, which is an
oft-reported preprocessing step for DKI, and that enforcing consistent axes of
symmetries across frequencies improves fitting quality. Thus, the use of an
efficient 10-direction scheme combined with the proposed DKI fitting algorithm
provides robust maps of frequency-dependent directional kurtosis parameters
that can be used to explore novel biomarkers for various pathologies.",2023-09-05T15:36:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02319v1,dentistry
"Tensor-valued and frequency-dependent diffusion MRI and magnetization
  transfer saturation MRI evolution during adult mouse brain maturation","Naila Rahman, Jake Hamilton, Kathy Xu, Arthur Brown, Corey A. Baron","Although rodent models are a predominant study model in neuroscience
research, research investigating healthy rodent brain maturation remains
limited. This motivates further study of normal brain maturation in rodents to
exclude confounds of developmental changes from interpretations of disease
mechanisms. 11 C57Bl/6 mice (6 males) were scanned longitudinally at 3, 4, 5,
and 8 months of age using frequency-dependent and tensor-valued diffusion MRI
(dMRI), and Magnetization Transfer saturation (MTsat) MRI. Total kurtosis
showed significant increases over time in all regions, which was driven by
increases in isotropic kurtosis while anisotropic kurtosis remained stable.
Increases in total and isotropic kurtosis with age were matched with increases
in MTsat. Quadratic fits revealed that most metrics show a maximum/minimum
around 5-6 months of age. Most dMRI metrics revealed significantly different
trajectories between males and females, while the MT metrics did not. Linear
fits between kurtosis and MT metrics highlighted that changes in total kurtosis
found throughout normal brain development are driven by isotropic kurtosis,
while differences in total kurtosis between brain regions are driven by
anisotropic kurtosis. Overall, the trends observed in conventional dMRI and MT
metrics are comparable to previous studies on normal brain development, while
the trajectories of our more advanced dMRI metrics provide novel insight. Based
on the developmental trajectories of tensor-valued dMRI and MT metrics, our
results suggest myelination during brain maturation is not a main contributor
to microscopic diffusion anisotropy and anisotropic kurtosis in axons. For
studies that only calculate total kurtosis, we suggest caution in attributing
neurobiological changes to changes in total kurtosis as we show here constant
anisotropic kurtosis in the presence of increasing myelin content.",2023-09-26T19:03:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15202v1,dentistry
Exact Solution of a Field Theory Model of Frontal Photopolymerization,"James A. Warren, Joao T. Cabral, Jack F. Douglas","Frontal photopolymerization (FPP) provides a versatile method for the rapid

needed to achieve this control. Previous work has relied on numerical solutions
of the governing kinetic equations in validating the model against experiments
because of the intractability of the governing nonlinear equations. The present
paper provides exact solutions to these equations in the general case in which
the optical attenuation decreases (photobleaching) or increases
(photodarkening) with photopolymerization. These exact solutions are of

productivity. The results indicate that there is a statistically significant
relationship between text features and grants productivity, however such a
dependence is weak. A feature relevance analysis revealed that the abstract
text length and metrics derived from lexical diversity are among the most
discriminative features. We also found that the prediction accuracy has a
dependence on the considered project language and that topical features are
more discriminative than text complexity measurements. Our findings suggest
that text features should be used in combination with other features to assist
the identification of relevant research ideas.",2020-05-17T13:51:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08254v2,dentistry
"Design of quantum correlation based automatic focus detection system
  during dental laser operation","Binh Xuan Cao, Duc An Pham","Dental laser has been developed recently and gradually replaced the
conventional dental treatment methods, especially in dental caries removal. The
utility of laser in dentistry contributes to reduce the pain during surgery and
decrease the risk of sequelae after surgery. Although bringing about several
beneficial properties such as excellent directionality, high speed, ultra-tiny
active area and tunable energy concentration, laser is still quite limited in
dental surgery because of the difficulty in real-time high precision detection
of laser focus during the operation. In this study, a cutting-edge optical
system for real-time focus detection during dental laser operation employing
the quantum entanglement of photon pairs created via spontaneous parametric
downconversion (SPDC) is presented. Defocusing distance of the specimen which
is used as the sample tooth can be determined precisely through spatial
correlation of photons arriving at the detectors. The proposed technique can be
applied to design automatic focus detection system for use in dental laser
operation.",2019-07-25T08:15:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07610v5,dentistry
Convolutional Neural Networks in Orthodontics: a review,"Szymon Płotka, Tomasz Włodarczyk, Ryszard Szczerba, Przemysław Rokita, Patrycja Bartkowska, Oskar Komisarek, Artur Matthews-Brzozowski, Tomasz Trzciński","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in many areas of computer
vision, such as object tracking and recognition, security, military, and
biomedical image analysis. This review presents the application of
convolutional neural networks in one of the fields of dentistry - orthodontics.
Advances in medical imaging technologies and methods allow CNNs to be used in
orthodontics to shorten the planning time of orthodontic treatment, including
an automatic search of landmarks on cephalometric X-ray images, tooth
segmentation on Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images or digital models,
and classification of defects on X-Ray panoramic images. In this work, we
describe the current methods, the architectures of deep convolutional neural
networks used, and their implementations, together with a comparison of the
results achieved by them. The promising results and visualizations of the
described studies show that the use of methods based on convolutional neural
networks allows for the improvement of computer-based orthodontic treatment

performing the analysis much more accurately than a manual orthodontist does.",2021-04-18T16:02:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08886v1,dentistry
On predicting research grants productivity,"Jorge A. V. Tohalino, Diego R. Amancio","Understanding the reasons associated with successful proposals is of
paramount importance to improve evaluation processes. In this context, we
analyzed whether bibliometric features are able to predict the success of
research grants. We extracted features aiming at characterizing the academic
history of Brazilian researchers, including research topics, affiliations,
number of publications and visibility. The extracted features were then used to
predict grants productivity via machine learning in three major research areas,
namely Medicine, Dentistry and Veterinary Medicine. We found that research
subject and publication history play a role in predicting productivity. In
addition, institution-based features turned out to be relevant when combined
with other features. While the best results outperformed text-based attributes,
the evaluated features were not highly discriminative. Our findings indicate
that predicting grants success, at least with the considered set of
bibliometric features, is not a trivial task.",2021-06-20T14:21:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10700v1,dentistry
Seed Words Based Data Selection for Language Model Adaptation,"Roberto Gretter, Marco Matassoni, Daniele Falavigna","We address the problem of language model customization in applications where
the ASR component needs to manage domain-specific terminology; although current
state-of-the-art speech recognition technology provides excellent results for
generic domains, the adaptation to specialized dictionaries or glossaries is
still an open issue. In this work we present an approach for automatically
selecting sentences, from a text corpus, that match, both semantically and
morphologically, a glossary of terms (words or composite words) furnished by
the user. The final goal is to rapidly adapt the language model of an hybrid
ASR system with a limited amount of in-domain text data in order to
successfully cope with the linguistic domain at hand; the vocabulary of the
baseline model is expanded and tailored, reducing the resulting OOV rate. Data
selection strategies based on shallow morphological seeds and semantic
similarity viaword2vec are introduced and discussed; the experimental setting
consists in a simultaneous interpreting scenario, where ASRs in three languages
are designed to recognize the domain-specific terms (i.e. dentistry). Results
using different metrics (OOV rate, WER, precision and recall) show the

"Masking Effects in Combined Hardness and Stiffness Rendering Using an
  Encountered-Type Haptic Display","Naghmeh Zamani, Heather Culbertson","Rendering stable hard surfaces is an important problem in haptics for many
tasks, including training simulators for orthopedic surgery or dentistry.
Current impedance devices cannot provide enough force and stiffness to render a
wall, and the high friction and inertia of admittance devices make it difficult
to render free space. We propose to address these limitations by combining
haptic augmented reality, untethered haptic interaction, and an
encountered-type haptic display. We attach a plate with the desired hardness on
the kinesthetic device's end-effector, which the user interacts with using an
untethered stylus. This method allows us to directly change the hardness of the
end-effector based on the rendered object. In this paper, we evaluate how
changing the hardness of the end-effector can mask the device's stiffness and
affect the user's perception. The results of our human subject experiment
indicate that when the end-effector is made of a hard material, it is difficult
for users to perceive when the underlying stiffness being rendered by the
device is changed, but this stiffness change is easy to distinguish while the
end-effector is made of a soft material. These results show promise for our
approach in avoiding the limitations of haptic devices when rendering hard
surfaces.",2021-10-13T18:53:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06982v1,dentistry

Automatic tracing of mandibular canal pathways using deep learning,"Mrinal Kanti Dhar, Zeyun Yu","There is an increasing demand in medical industries to have automated systems
for detection and localization which are manually inefficient otherwise. In
dentistry, it bears great interest to trace the pathway of mandibular canals
accurately. Proper localization of the position of the mandibular canals, which
surrounds the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), reduces the risk of damaging it
during dental implantology. Manual detection of canal paths is not an efficient
way in terms of time and labor. Here, we propose a deep learning-based
framework to detect mandibular canals from CBCT data. It is a 3-stage process
fully automatic end-to-end. Ground truths are generated in the preprocessing
stage. Instead of using commonly used fixed diameter tubular-shaped ground
truth, we generate centerlines of the mandibular canals and used them as ground
truths in the training process. A 3D U-Net architecture is used for model
training. An efficient post-processing stage is developed to rectify the
initial prediction. The precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU are measured to
analyze the voxel-level segmentation performance. However, to analyze the
distance-based measurements, mean curve distance (MCD) both from ground truth
to prediction and prediction to ground truth is calculated. Extensive
experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model.",2021-11-30T04:06:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15111v1,dentistry
"Tooth Instance Segmentation on Panoramic Dental Radiographs Using U-Nets
  and Morphological Processing","Selahattin Serdar Helli, Andac Hamamci","Automatic teeth segmentation in panoramic x-ray images is an important
research subject of the image analysis in dentistry. In this study, we propose
a post-processing stage to obtain a segmentation map in which the objects in
the image are separated, and apply this technique to tooth instance
segmentation with U-Net network. The post-processing consists of grayscale
morphological and filtering operations, which are applied to the sigmoid output
of the network before binarization. A dice overlap score of 95.4 - 0.3% is
obtained in overall teeth segmentation. The proposed post-processing stages
reduce the mean error of tooth count to 6.15%, whereas the error without
post-processing is 26.81%. The performances of both segmentation and tooth
counting are the highest in the literature, to our knowledge. Moreover, this is
achieved by using a relatively small training dataset, which consists of 105

"A Critical Analysis of the Limitation of Deep Learning based 3D Dental
  Mesh Segmentation Methods in Segmenting Partial Scans","Ananya Jana, Aniruddha Maiti, Dimitris N. Metaxas","Tooth segmentation from intraoral scans is a crucial part of digital
dentistry. Many Deep Learning based tooth segmentation algorithms have been

jaw models. Medically, however, in certain cases, full jaw tooth scan is not
required or may not be available. Given this practical issue, it is important
to understand the robustness of currently available widely used Deep Learning
based tooth segmentation techniques. For this purpose, we applied available

Variational Autoencoding of Dental Point Clouds,"Johan Ziruo Ye, Thomas Ørkild, Peter Lempel Søndergaard, Søren Hauberg","Digital dentistry has made significant advancements, yet numerous challenges
remain. This paper introduces the FDI 16 dataset, an extensive collection of

Variational FoldingNet (VF-Net), a fully probabilistic variational autoencoder

one-to-one correspondence between input and output points. Instead, they rely
on optimizing Chamfer distances, a metric that lacks a normalized
distributional counterpart, rendering it unsuitable for probabilistic modeling.
We replace the explicit minimization of Chamfer distances with a suitable
encoder, increasing computational efficiency while simplifying the
probabilistic extension. This allows for straightforward application in various
tasks, including mesh generation, shape completion, and representation

effects between the rising and declining phases of the outburst. In contrast,
the second harmonic energy changed from ~49 to ~54 keV, implying a weaker
fractional change as a function of the luminosity. As a result, the observed
resonance energy ratio between the second harmonic and the fundamental was ~2.2
when the source was most luminous, whereas the ratio decreased to the nominal

A Novel Hybrid Approach for Cephalometric Landmark Detection,"Mahshid Majd, Farzaneh Shoeleh","Cephalometric analysis has an important role in dentistry and especially in
orthodontics as a treatment planning tool to gauge the size and special
relationships of the teeth, jaws and cranium. The first step of using such
analyses is localizing some important landmarks known as cephalometric
landmarks on craniofacial in x-ray image. The past decade has seen a growing
interest in automating this process. In this paper, a novel hybrid approach is
proposed for automatic detection of cephalometric landmarks. Here, the
landmarks are categorized into three main sets according to their anatomical
characteristics and usage in well-known cephalometric analyses. Consequently,
to have a reliable and accurate detection system, three methods named edge
tracing, weighted template matching, and analysis based estimation are
designed, each of which is consistent and well-suited for one category. Edge
tracing method is suggested to predict those landmarks which are located on
edges. Weighted template matching method is well-suited for landmarks located
in an obvious and specific structure which can be extracted or searchable in a
given x-ray image. The last but not the least method is named analysis based
estimation. This method is based on the fact that in cephalometric analyses the
relations between landmarks are used and the locations of some landmarks are
never used individually. Therefore the third suggested method has a novelty in
estimating the desired relations directly. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach is compared with the state of the art methods and the results were
promising especially in real world applications.",2015-06-12T08:40:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03936v1,dentistry

the use of HA as a facial filler to correct lip scars in patients with CLP. By
a literature and transverse search in Scientific Electronic Library Online and

With the MAXI/GSC, a low-level active period, or a ""precursor"", was detected

a one-armed disc structure and the other a Be-disc precession, are discussed.",2013-08-26T07:13:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5498v1,dentistry
"Group Methodologies and Simulations for the Development of Transversal
  Skills: A Pilot Study on Health Sciences Higher Education","Laura San Martin Galindo, Juan Jose Cabrera-Martinez, Camilo Abalos-Labruzzi, Jose Gomez-Galan","One of the methodologies based on group dynamics is Role Playing (RP). This
method consists on the simulation of a real situation, allowing its study and
understanding. Knowledge and technical skills are not the only prerequisites
for proper practice in health sciences. RP has been used as Communication
Skills Training (CST) amongst health professionals. In the teaching of
odontology and stomatology, object of our research, dental assistance brings up
situations where the professional must develop transversal skills, which
improve the interaction with the patient and the dental treatment itself. The
aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed RP methodology
through the students' opinion. The study sample is made out of dental students
(n=80), all of them on the 4th year at the College of Dentistry (University of
Seville, Spain). The students who took part in the activity considered the
incorporation of RP in the syllabus as relevant, though further study should be
considered in order to analyze the efficacy of this teaching methodology in
depth.",2016-05-21T15:26:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06658v1,dentistry
LiftUpp: Support to develop learner performance,"Frans A. Oliehoek, Rahul Savani, Elliot Adderton, Xia Cui, David Jackson, Phil Jimmieson, John Christopher Jones, Keith Kennedy, Ben Mason, Adam Plumbley, Luke Dawson","Various motivations exist to move away from the simple assessment of
knowledge towards the more complex assessment and development of competence.
However, to accommodate such a change, high demands are put on the supporting
e-infrastructure in terms of intelligently collecting and analysing data. In
this paper, we discuss these challenges and how they are being addressed by
LiftUpp, a system that is now used in 70% of UK dental schools, and is finding
wider applications in physiotherapy, medicine and veterinary science. We
describe how data is collected for workplace-based development in dentistry
using a dedicated iPad app, which enables an integrated approach to linking and
assessing work flows, skills and learning outcomes. Furthermore, we detail how
the various forms of collected data can be fused, visualized and integrated
with conventional forms of assessment. This enables curriculum integration,
improved real-time student feedback, support for administration, and informed
instructional planning. Together these facets contribute to better support for
the development of learners' competence in situated learning setting, as well
as an improved experience. Finally, we discuss several directions for future
research on intelligent teaching systems that are afforded by using the design
present within LiftUpp.",2017-04-21T14:04:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06549v1,dentistry
