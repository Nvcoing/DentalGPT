"Tissue Engineering for Periodontal Ligament Regeneration: Biomechanical
  Specifications","R. Gauthier, Christophe Jeannin, N. Attik, Ana-Maria Trunfio-Sfarghiu, K. Gritsch, B. Grosgogeat","The periodontal biomechanical environment is very difficult to investigate.
By the complex geometry and composition of the periodontal ligament, its
mechanical behavior is very dependent on the type of loading (compressive vs.
tensile loading; static vs. cyclic loading; uniaxial vs. multiaxial) and the
location around the root (cervical, middle, or apical). These different aspects
of the periodontal ligament make it difficult to develop a functional
biomaterial to treat periodontal attachment due to periodontal diseases. This
review aims to describe the structural and biomechanical properties of the
periodontal ligament. Particular importance is placed in the close
interrelationship that exists between structure and biomechanics: the
periodontal ligament structural organization is specific to its biomechanical
environment, and its biomechanical properties are specific to its structural
arrangement. This balance between structure and biomechanics can be explained
by a mechanosensitive periodontal cellular activity. These specifications have
to be considered in the further tissue engineering strategies for the
development of an efficient biomaterial for periodontal tissues regeneration.",2020-12-29T09:43:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14683v1,periodontitis
"Relationship between Periodontal disease and Asthma among
  overweight/obese adults","Roberto Rivera, Oelisoa M. Andriankaja, Cynthia M. Perez, Kaumudi Joshipura","Aim: To assess the relationship between oral health and asthma. Methods: Data
from 1,315 overweight or obese individuals, aged 40-65 years was used. Asthma
was self-reported, while periodontitis, bleeding on probing (BOP), and plaque
index were determined by clinical examinations. Results: Using logistic
regression adjusting for gender, smoking status, age, body mass index, family
history of asthma, and income level, revealed that the odds ratio (OR) of
asthma for a participant with severe periodontitis was 0.44 (95% confidence
interval: 0.27, 0.70) that of a participant with none/mild periodontitis . On
the other hand, proportion of BOP sites, and plaque index were not
statistically significant. For a participant with severe periodontitis, the OR
of taking asthma medication was 0.20 (95% confidence interval: 0.09, 0.43) that
of a participant with none/mild periodontitis. Moreover, proportion of BOP
sites was statistically associated to use of asthma medication while plaque
index still remained non-significant. Conclusion: Participants with severe
periodontitis were less likely to have asthma. Stronger evidence of an inverse
association was found when using asthma medication as outcome. Keywords:

"An End-to-end Entangled Segmentation and Classification Convolutional
  Neural Network for Periodontitis Stage Grading from Periapical Radiographic
  Images","Tanjida Kabir, Chun-Teh Lee, Jiman Nelson, Sally Sheng, Hsiu-Wan Meng, Luyao Chen, Muhammad F Walji, Xioaqian Jiang, Shayan Shams","Periodontitis is a biofilm-related chronic inflammatory disease characterized
by gingivitis and bone loss in the teeth area. Approximately 61 million adults
over 30 suffer from periodontitis (42.2%), with 7.8% having severe
periodontitis in the United States. The measurement of radiographic bone loss
(RBL) is necessary to make a correct periodontal diagnosis, especially if the
comprehensive and longitudinal periodontal mapping is unavailable. However,
doctors can interpret X-rays differently depending on their experience and
knowledge. Computerized diagnosis support for doctors sheds light on making the
diagnosis with high accuracy and consistency and drawing up an appropriate
treatment plan for preventing or controlling periodontitis. We developed an
end-to-end deep learning network HYNETS (Hybrid NETwork for pEriodoNTiTiS
STagES from radiograpH) by integrating segmentation and classification tasks
for grading periodontitis from periapical radiographic images. HYNETS leverages
a multi-task learning strategy by combining a set of segmentation networks and
a classification network to provide an end-to-end interpretable solution and
highly accurate and consistent results. HYNETS achieved the average dice
coefficient of 0.96 and 0.94 for the bone area and tooth segmentation and the
average AUC of 0.97 for periodontitis stage assignment. Additionally,
conventional image processing techniques provide RBL measurements and build
transparency and trust in the model's prediction. HYNETS will potentially
transform clinical diagnosis from a manual time-consuming, and error-prone task
to an efficient and automated periodontitis stage assignment based on
periapical radiographic images.",2021-09-27T15:28:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13120v1,periodontitis
"A semi-parametric Bayesian model of inter- and intra-examiner agreement
  for periodontal probing depth","E. G. Hill, E. H. Slate","Periodontal probing depth is a measure of periodontitis severity. We develop
a Bayesian hierarchical model linking true pocket depth to both observed and
recorded values of periodontal probing depth, while permitting correlation
among measures obtained from the same mouth and between duplicate examiners'
measures obtained at the same periodontal site. Periodontal site-specific
examiner effects are modeled as arising from a Dirichlet process mixture,
facilitating identification of classes of sites that are measured with similar
bias. Using simulated data, we demonstrate the model's ability to recover
examiner site-specific bias and variance heterogeneity and to provide
cluster-adjusted point and interval agreement estimates. We conclude with an

  Correlation of Oral Diseases with Systemic Health","Gregory Yauney, Aman Rana, Lawrence C. Wong, Perikumar Javia, Ali Muftu, Pratik Shah","Imaging fluorescent disease biomarkers in tissues and skin is a non-invasive
method to screen for health conditions. We report an automated process that
combines intraoral fluorescent porphyrin biomarker imaging, clinical
examinations and machine learning for correlation of systemic health conditions
with periodontal disease. 1215 intraoral fluorescent images, from 284
consenting adults aged 18-90, were analyzed using a machine learning classifier
that can segment periodontal inflammation. The classifier achieved an AUC of
0.677 with precision and recall of 0.271 and 0.429, respectively, indicating a
learned association between disease signatures in collected images. Periodontal
diseases were more prevalent among males (p=0.0012) and older subjects
(p=0.0224) in the screened population. Physicians independently examined the
collected images, assigning localized modified gingival indices (MGIs). MGIs
and periodontal disease were then cross-correlated with responses to a medical
history questionnaire, blood pressure and body mass index measurements, and
optic nerve, tympanic membrane, neurological, and cardiac rhythm imaging
examinations. Gingivitis and early periodontal disease were associated with
subjects diagnosed with optic nerve abnormalities (p <0.0001) in their retinal
scans. We also report significant co-occurrences of periodontal disease in
subjects reporting swollen joints (p=0.0422) and a family history of eye
disease (p=0.0337). These results indicate cross-correlation of poor
periodontal health with systemic health outcomes and stress the importance of
oral health screenings at the primary care level. Our screening process and

Numerical simulation of the stress-strain state of the dental system,"Sergey V. Lemeshevsky, Semion A. Naumovich, Sergey S. Naumovich, Petr N. Vabishchevich, Petr E. Zakharov","We present mathematical models, computational algorithms and software, which
can be used for prediction of results of prosthetic treatment. More interest
issue is biomechanics of the periodontal complex because any prosthesis is
accompanied by a risk of overloading the supporting elements. Such risk can be
avoided by the proper load distribution and prediction of stresses that occur
during the use of dentures. We developed the mathematical model of the
periodontal complex and its software implementation. This model is based on
linear elasticity theory and allows to calculate the stress and strain fields
in periodontal ligament and jawbone. The input parameters for the developed
model can be divided into two groups. The first group of parameters describes
the mechanical properties of periodontal ligament, teeth and jawbone (for
example, elasticity of periodontal ligament etc.). The second group
characterized the geometric properties of objects: the size of the teeth, their
spatial coordinates, the size of periodontal ligament etc. The mechanical
properties are the same for almost all, but the input of geometrical data is
complicated because of their individual characteristics. In this connection, we
develop algorithms and software for processing of images obtained by computed
tomography (CT) scanner and for constructing individual digital model of the
tooth-periodontal ligament-jawbone system of the patient. Integration of models
and algorithms described allows to carry out biomechanical analysis on
three-dimensional digital model and to select prosthesis design.",2015-09-17T11:19:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05208v1,periodontitis

A latent factor model for spatial data with informative missingness,"Brian J. Reich, Dipankar Bandyopadhyay","A large amount of data is typically collected during a periodontal exam.
Analyzing these data poses several challenges. Several types of measurements
are taken at many locations throughout the mouth. These spatially-referenced
data are a mix of binary and continuous responses, making joint modeling
difficult. Also, most patients have missing teeth. Periodontal disease is a
leading cause of tooth loss, so it is likely that the number and location of
missing teeth informs about the patient's periodontal health. In this paper we
develop a multivariate spatial framework for these data which jointly models
the binary and continuous responses as a function of a single latent spatial
process representing general periodontal health. We also use the latent spatial
process to model the location of missing teeth. We show using simulated and
real data that exploiting spatial associations and jointly modeling the
responses and locations of missing teeth mitigates the problems presented by
these data.",2010-10-07T13:37:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1430v1,periodontitis

  Post-Processing","Ryan Banks, Vishal Thengane, María Eugenia Guerrero, Nelly Maria García-Madueño, Yunpeng Li, Hongying Tang, Akhilanand Chaurasia","Calculating percentage bone loss is a critical test for periodontal disease
staging but is sometimes imprecise and time consuming when manually calculated.
This study evaluates the application of a deep learning keypoint and object
detection model, YOLOv8-pose, for the automatic identification of localised
periodontal bone loss landmarks, conditions and staging. YOLOv8-pose was
fine-tuned on 193 annotated periapical radiographs. We propose a keypoint
detection metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), which
normalises the metric to the average tooth size of teeth in the image. We
propose a heuristic post-processing module that adjusts certain keypoint
predictions to align with the edge of the related tooth, using a supporting
instance segmentation model trained on an open source auxiliary dataset. The
model can sufficiently detect bone loss keypoints, tooth boxes, and alveolar
ridge resorption, but has insufficient performance at detecting detached
periodontal ligament and furcation involvement. The model with post-processing
demonstrated a PRCK 0.25 of 0.726 and PRCK 0.05 of 0.401 for keypoint
detection, mAP 0.5 of 0.715 for tooth object detection, mesial dice score of

periodontal disease detection, by ensuring most keypoints are present for each
tooth in the image, allowing small imbalanced datasets. Our PRCK metric allows
accurate evaluation of keypoints in dental domains. Our post-processing module

Use of the Deep Learning Approach to Measure Alveolar Bone Level,"Chun-Teh Lee, Tanjida Kabir, Jiman Nelson, Sally Sheng, Hsiu-Wan Meng, Thomas E. Van Dyke, Muhammad F. Walji, Xiaoqian Jiang, Shayan Shams","Abstract:
  Aim: The goal was to use a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to measure the
radiographic alveolar bone level to aid periodontal diagnosis.
  Material and methods: A Deep Learning (DL) model was developed by integrating
three segmentation networks (bone area, tooth, cementoenamel junction) and
image analysis to measure the radiographic bone level and assign radiographic
bone loss (RBL) stages. The percentage of RBL was calculated to determine the
stage of RBL for each tooth. A provisional periodontal diagnosis was assigned
using the 2018 periodontitis classification. RBL percentage, staging, and
presumptive diagnosis were compared to the measurements and diagnoses made by
the independent examiners.
  Results: The average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) for segmentation was
over 0.91. There was no significant difference in RBL percentage measurements
determined by DL and examiners (p=0.65). The Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristics Curve of RBL stage assignment for stage I, II and III was 0.89,
0.90 and 0.90, respectively. The accuracy of the case diagnosis was 0.85.
  Conclusion: The proposed DL model provides reliable RBL measurements and
image-based periodontal diagnosis using periapical radiographic images.
However, this model has to be further optimized and validated by a larger
number of images to facilitate its application.",2021-09-24T17:48:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12115v1,periodontitis
"Bayesian Nonparametric Policy Search with Application to Periodontal
  Recall Intervals","Qian Guan, Brian J. Reich, Eric B. Laber, Dipankar Bandyopadhyay","Tooth loss from periodontal disease is a major public health burden in the
United States. Standard clinical practice is to recommend a dental visit every
six months; however, this practice is not evidence-based, and poor dental
outcomes and increasing dental insurance premiums indicate room for
improvement. We consider a tailored approach that recommends recall time based
on patient characteristics and medical history to minimize disease progression
without increasing resource expenditures. We formalize this method as a dynamic
treatment regime which comprises a sequence of decisions, one per stage of
intervention, that follow a decision rule which maps current patient
information to a recommendation for their next visit time. The dynamics of
periodontal health, visit frequency, and patient compliance are complex, yet
the estimated optimal regime must be interpretable to domain experts if it is
to be integrated into clinical practice. We combine non-parametric Bayesian
dynamics modeling with policy-search algorithms to estimate the optimal dynamic
treatment regime within an interpretable class of regimes. Both simulation
experiments and application to a rich database of electronic dental records

Quantitative Ultrasound for Periodontal Soft Tissue Characterization,"Daria Poul, Ankita Samal, Amanda Rodriguez Betancourt, Carole Quesada, Hsun-Liang Chan, Oliver D. Kripfgans","Periodontal diseases affect 45.9\% of adults aged 30 or older in the United
States. Current diagnostic methods for clinical assessment of these diseases
are visual examination and bleeding on probing that are subjective,
qualitative, and/or invasive. Thus, there is a critical need for research on
noninvasive modalities for periodontal tissue characterization. Quantitative
Ultrasound (QUS) has shown promising results in noninvasive characterization of
various soft tissues; however, it has not been used in periodontics. This study
is among initial investigations into the application of QUS for periodontal
tissue characterization in the literature. Here, QUS analysis of oral soft
tissues (alveolar mucosa and gingiva) is performed in an in vivo animal study
including 10 swine. US scanning was performed at the first molar of all four
oral quadrants, resulting in a total of 40 scans. We investigated first order
speckle statistics of oral tissues by using the two-parameter Burr (power-law b
and scale factor l) and Nakagami models (shape factor m and scale factor
$\alpha$). Parametric imaging of these parameters was created using a sliding
kernel method sweeping regions of interest with a kernel size of 10 wavelengths
from a phantom study. Results showed that the difference between gingiva and
alveolar mucosa were statistically significant using Burr and Nakagami
parameters ($p-value<0.0001$). The Burr b and Nakagami m were higher in gingiva
while the Burr l and Nakagami {$\alpha$} were higher in alveolar mucosa.
Findings from QUS analyses agreed with observation from histology that showed
denser stains for gingiva. Linear classifications of these tissues using 2D
parameter spaces of the Burr and Nakagami models resulted in a segmentation
accuracy of 93.51\% and 90.91\%, respectively. We propose that QUS holds

BAREB: A Bayesian repulsive biclustering model for periodontal data,"Yuliang Li, Dipankar Bandyopadhyay, Fangzheng Xie, Yanxun Xu","Preventing periodontal diseases (PD) and maintaining the structure and
function of teeth are important goals for personal oral care. To understand the
heterogeneity in patients with diverse PD patterns, we develop BAREB, a
Bayesian repulsive biclustering method that can simultaneously cluster the PD
patients and their tooth sites after taking the patient- and site- level
covariates into consideration. BAREB uses the determinantal point process (DPP)
prior to induce diversity among different biclusters to facilitate parsimony
and interpretability. Since PD progression is hypothesized to be
spatially-referenced, BAREB factors in the spatial dependence among tooth
sites. In addition, since PD is the leading cause for tooth loss, the missing
data mechanism is non-ignorable. Such nonrandom missingness is incorporated
into BAREB. For the posterior inference, we design an efficient reversible jump
Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. Simulation studies show that BAREB is able to
accurately estimate the biclusters, and compares favorably to alternatives. For
real world application, we apply BAREB to a dataset from a clinical PD study,

matrix consisting of interpretable loadings and low-dimensional scores which
can be used for further analyses. We develop an efficient and robust
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation. We
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method using comprehensive simulation
studies. The application to the Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and

Bayesian nonparametric multiway regression for clustered binomial data,"Eric F. Lock, Dipankar Bandyopadhyay","We introduce a Bayesian nonparametric regression model for data with multiway
(tensor) structure, motivated by an application to periodontal disease (PD)
data. Our outcome is the number of diseased sites measured over four different
tooth types for each subject, with subject-specific covariates available as
predictors. The outcomes are not well-characterized by simple parametric
models, so we use a nonparametric approach with a binomial likelihood wherein
the latent probabilities are drawn from a mixture with an arbitrary number of
components, analogous to a Dirichlet Process (DP). We use a flexible probit
stick-breaking formulation for the component weights that allows for covariate
dependence and clustering structure in the outcomes. The parameter space for
this model is large and multiway: patients $\times$ tooth types $\times$
covariates $\times$ components. We reduce its effective dimensionality, and
account for the multiway structure, via low-rank assumptions. We illustrate how
this can improve performance, and simplify interpretation, while still
providing sufficient flexibility. We describe a general and efficient Gibbs
sampling algorithm for posterior computation. The resulting fit to the PD data
outperforms competitors, and is interpretable and well-calibrated. An
interactive visual of the predictive model is available at
http://ericfrazerlock.com/toothdata/ToothDisplay.html , and the code is

"Developing a Novel Approach for Periapical Dental Radiographs
  Segmentation","Elaheh Hatamimajoumerd, Farshad Tajeripour","Image processing techniques has been widely used in dental researches such as
human identification and forensic dentistry, teeth numbering, dental carries
detection and periodontal disease analysis. One of the most challenging parts
in dental imaging is teeth segmentation and how to separate them from each
other. In this paper, an automated method for teeth segmentation of Periapical
dental x-ray images which contain at least one root-canalled tooth is proposed.
The result of this approach can be used as an initial step in bone lesion
detection. The proposed algorithm is made of two stages. The first stage is
pre-processing. The second and main part of this algorithm calculated rotation
degree and uses the integral projection method for tooth isolation.
Experimental results show that this algorithm is robust and achieves high

  Size","Changrui Liu, Solomon W. Harrar","In clustered data setting, informative cluster size has been a focus of
recent research. In the nonparametric context, the problem has been considered
mainly for testing equality of distribution functions. The aim in this paper is
to develop inferential procedure for the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whintey effect (also
known as the nonprametric relative effect). Unbiased estimator is provided and
its asymptotic properties are investigated. The asymptotic theory is employed
to develop inferential methods. While the proposed method takes information in
the cluster sizes into consideration when constructing the estimator, it is
equally applicable for ignorable cluster size situation. Simulation results
show that our method appropriately accounts for informative cluster size and it
generally outperforms existing methods, especially those designed under
ignorable cluster sizes. The applications of the method is illustrated using
data from a longitudinal study of alcohol use and a periodontal study.",2022-12-13T23:15:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06938v1,periodontitis

"Off-Policy Evaluation with Irregularly-Spaced, Outcome-Dependent
  Observation Times","Xin Chen, Wenbin Lu, Shu Yang, Dipankar Bandyopadhyay","While the classic off-policy evaluation (OPE) literature commonly assumes
decision time points to be evenly spaced for simplicity, in many real-world
scenarios, such as those involving user-initiated visits, decisions are made at
irregularly-spaced and potentially outcome-dependent time points. For a more
principled evaluation of the dynamic policies, this paper constructs a novel
OPE framework, which concerns not only the state-action process but also an
observation process dictating the time points at which decisions are made. The
framework is closely connected to the Markov decision process in computer
science and with the renewal process in the statistical literature. Within the
framework, two distinct value functions, derived from cumulative reward and
integrated reward respectively, are considered, and statistical inference for
each value function is developed under revised Markov and time-homogeneous
assumptions. The validity of the proposed method is further supported by
theoretical results, simulation studies, and a real-world application from
electronic health records (EHR) evaluating periodontal disease treatments.",2024-09-14T00:11:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09236v1,periodontitis
Computational Orthodontic Force Simulation: A Review,"Waheed Ahmad, Jing Xiong, Zeyang Xia","In orthodontic treatment, the biological response of the tooth, periodontal
ligament, and bone complex to orthodontic force is crucial in influencing
treatment outcomes. The challenge lies in accurately measuring, estimating, and
predicting these forces during clinical procedures. This review aims to fill
the gap in the literature by systematically summarizing existing research on
orthodontic force simulation, examining common loading techniques and
technologies, and discussing the potential for refining the orthodontic force
simulation process. The literature was comprehensively reviewed, with an
emphasis on the exploration of the biological mechanism of tooth movement.
Studies were categorized based on force-loading techniques for both fixed and
invisible orthodontic appliances. Finite element (FE) analysis stands out as
the predominant technique for orthodontic force simulation, with a significant
focus on fixed orthodontics but limited emphasis on invisible orthodontics.
Current orthodontic force simulations tend to be fragmented, often considering
only the instantaneous response to applied forces. There exists an urgent
demand for a sophisticated analytical simulation model. Such a model, possibly
leveraging advanced technologies like deep learning, holds the promise of
forecasting orthodontic treatment outcomes with heightened precision and

"Efficient Estimation of Mixture Cure Frailty Model for Clustered Current
  Status Data","Tong Wang, Kejun He, Wei Ma, Dipankar Bandyopadhyay, Samiran Sinha","Current status data abounds in the field of epidemiology and public health,
where the only observable data for a subject is the random inspection time and
the event status at inspection. Motivated by such a current status data from a
periodontal study where data are inherently clustered, we propose a unified
methodology to analyze such complex data. We allow the time-to-event to follow
the semiparametric GOR model with a cure fraction, and develop a unified
estimation scheme powered by the EM algorithm. The within-subject correlation
is accounted for by a random (frailty) effect, and the non-parametric component
of the GOR model is approximated via penalized splines, with a set of knot
points that increases with the sample size. Proposed methodology is accompanied
by a rigorous asymptotic theory, and the related semiparametric efficiency. The
finite sample performance of our model parameters are assessed via simulation
studies. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is illustrated via application
to the oral health data, accompanied by diagnostic checks to identify
influential observations. An easy to use R package CRFCSD is also available for
implementation.",2019-12-01T00:41:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00295v3,periodontitis
"Local tissue effects and peri-implant bone healing induced by implant
  surface treatment: an in vivo study in the sheep","Nicolas Rousseau, Ines Msolli, Patrick Chabrand, Arnaud Destainville, Olivier Richart, Jean-Louis Milan","Objective: The aim of this study was to assess, through biological analysis,
the local effects and osseointegration of dental implants incorporating surface
micro/nanofeatures compared to implants of identical design without surface
treatment. Background: Known to impact bone cell behavior, surface chemical and
topography modifications target improved osseointegration and long-term success
of dental implants. Very few studies assess the performance of implants
presenting both micro-and nanofeatures in vivo on the animal models used in
preclinical studies for medical device certification. Methods: Implant surfaces
were characterized in terms of topography and surface chemical composition.
After 4 weeks and 13 weeks of implantation in sheep femoral condyles, forty
implants were evaluated through micro-computed tomography, histopathologic, and
histomorphometric analyses. Results: No local adverse effects were observed
around implants. Histomorphometric analyses showed significantly higher
bone-to-implant contact in the coronal region of the surface treated implant at
week 4 and week 13, respectively 79.3$\pm$11.2% and 86.4$\pm$6.7%, compared to
the untreated implant's 68.3$\pm$8.8% and 74.8$\pm$13%. Micro-computed
tomography analyses revealed that healing patterns differed between coronal and
apical regions, with higher coronal boneto-implant contact at week 13.
Histopathologic results showed, at week 13, bone healing around the surface
treated implant with undistinguishable defect margins while the untreated
implant still presented bone condensation and traces of the initial drill
defect. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the surface treated implant not
only shows no deleterious effects on local tissues but also promotes faster
bone healing around the implant. (word count: 241",2021-04-09T07:33:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04223v1,periodontitis
"A robust fusion-extraction procedure with summary statistics in the
  presence of biased sources","Ruoyu Wang, Qihua Wang, Wang Miao","Information from various data sources is increasingly available nowadays.
However, some of the data sources may produce biased estimation due to commonly
encountered biased sampling, population heterogeneity, or model
misspecification. This calls for statistical methods to combine information in
the presence of biased sources. In this paper, a robust data fusion-extraction
method is proposed. The method can produce a consistent estimator of the
parameter of interest even if many of the data sources are biased. The proposed
estimator is easy to compute and only employs summary statistics, and hence can
be applied to many different fields, e.g. meta-analysis, Mendelian
randomisation and distributed system. Moreover, the proposed estimator is
asymptotically equivalent to the oracle estimator that only uses data from
unbiased sources under some mild conditions. Asymptotic normality of the
proposed estimator is also established. In contrast to the existing
meta-analysis methods, the theoretical properties are guaranteed even if both
the number of data sources and the dimension of the parameter diverge as the
sample size increases, which ensures the performance of the proposed method
over a wide range. The robustness and oracle property is also evaluated via
simulation studies. The proposed method is applied to a meta-analysis data set
to evaluate the surgical treatment for the moderate periodontal disease, and a
Mendelian randomization data set to study the risk factors of head and neck
cancer.",2021-08-28T08:06:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12600v3,periodontitis
"Multiple Idiopathic Cervical Root Resorption: A Challenge for a
  Transdisciplinary Medical-Dental Team","Emily Y. Chu, Janina Golob Deeb, Brian L. Foster, Evlambia Hajishengalis, Martha J. Somerman, Vivek Thumbigere-Math","While tooth root resorption is a normal physiological process required for
resorption and exfoliation of primary teeth, root resorption of adult teeth is
largely pathological. This perspective focuses on multiple idiopathic cervical
root resorption (MICRR), an aggressive form of external root resorption that
occurs near the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ). The cause of MICRR remains
elusive, however, it is mediated primarily by osteoclasts/odontoclasts.
Accumulating case studies and experiments in animal models have provided
insights into defining the etiologies and pathophysiological mechanisms for
MICRR, which include: systemic conditions and syndromes, inherited genetic
variants affecting osteoclast/odontoclast activity, altered periodontal
structures, drug-induced root resorption and rebound effects after cessation of
anti-resorptive treatment, chemotherapy, exposure to pets or viral infections,
and other factors such as inflammatory conditions or trauma. To determine the
causative factors, at minimum, a comprehensive health history should be
collected for all patients by dental care providers, discussed with other
health care providers and appropriate collaborations established. The examples
highlighted in this perspective emphasize the need for transdisciplinary
research collaborations coupled with integrated management strategies between
medicine and dentistry in order to identify cause(s) early and improve clinical
outcomes.",2021-01-12T16:30:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04583v1,periodontitis
"Adjusting for informative cluster size in pseudo-value based regression
  approaches with clustered time to event data","Samuel Anyaso-Samuel, Somnath Datta","Informative cluster size (ICS) arises in situations with clustered data where
a latent relationship exists between the number of participants in a cluster
and the outcome measures. Although this phenomenon has been sporadically
reported in statistical literature for nearly two decades now, further
exploration is needed in certain statistical methodologies to avoid potentially
misleading inferences. For inference about population quantities without
covariates, inverse cluster size reweightings are often employed to adjust for
ICS. Further, to study the effect of covariates on disease progression
described by a multistate model, the pseudo-value regression technique has
gained popularity in time-to-event data analysis. We seek to answer the
question: ""How to apply pseudo-value regression to clustered time-to-event data
when cluster size is informative?"" ICS adjustment by the reweighting method can
be performed in two steps; estimation of marginal functions of the multistate
model and fitting the estimating equations based on pseudo-value responses,
leading to four possible strategies. We present theoretical arguments and
thorough simulation experiments to ascertain the correct strategy for adjusting
for ICS. A further extension of our methodology is implemented to include
informativeness induced by the intra-cluster group size. We demonstrate the
methods in two real-world applications: (i) to determine predictors of tooth
survival in a periodontal study, and (ii) to identify indicators of ambulatory
recovery in spinal cord injury patients who participated in locomotor-training
rehabilitation.",2022-10-24T17:11:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13410v2,periodontitis
"Pseudo-value regression of clustered multistate current status data with
  informative cluster sizes","Samuel Anyaso-Samuel, Dipankar Bandyopadhyay, Somnath Datta","Multistate current status (CS) data presents a more severe form of censoring
due to the single observation of study participants transitioning through a
sequence of well-defined disease states at random inspection times. Moreover,
these data may be clustered within specified groups, and informativeness of the
cluster sizes may arise due to the existing latent relationship between the
transition outcomes and the cluster sizes. Failure to adjust for this
informativeness may lead to a biased inference. Motivated by a clinical study
of periodontal disease (PD), we propose an extension of the pseudo-value
approach to estimate covariate effects on the state occupation probabilities
(SOP) for these clustered multistate CS data with informative cluster or
intra-cluster group sizes. In our approach, the proposed pseudo-value technique
initially computes marginal estimators of the SOP utilizing nonparametric
regression. Next, the estimating equations based on the corresponding
pseudo-values are reweighted by functions of the cluster sizes to adjust for
informativeness. We perform a variety of simulation studies to study the
properties of our pseudo-value regression based on the nonparametric marginal
estimators under different scenarios of informativeness. For illustration, the
method is applied to the motivating PD dataset, which encapsulates the complex
data-generation mechanism.",2022-11-20T01:24:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10839v2,periodontitis
"Towards Earlier Detection of Oral Diseases On Smartphones Using Oral and
  Dental RGB Images","Ayush Garg, Julia Lu, Anika Maji","Oral diseases such as periodontal (gum) diseases and dental caries (cavities)
affect billions of people across the world today. However, previous
state-of-the-art models have relied on X-ray images to detect oral diseases,
making them inaccessible to remote monitoring, developing countries, and
telemedicine. To combat this overuse of X-ray imagery, we propose a lightweight
machine learning model capable of detecting calculus (also known as hardened
plaque or tartar) in RGB images while running efficiently on low-end devices.
The model, a modified MobileNetV3-Small neural network transfer learned from
ImageNet, achieved an accuracy of 72.73% (which is comparable to
state-of-the-art solutions) while still being able to run on mobile devices due
to its reduced memory requirements and processing times. A ResNet34-based model

"Statistical validation of a deep learning algorithm for dental anomaly
  detection in intraoral radiographs using paired data","Pieter Van Leemput, Johannes Keustermans, Wouter Mollemans","This article describes the clinical validation study setup, statistical
analysis and results for a deep learning algorithm which detects dental
anomalies in intraoral radiographic images, more specifically caries, apical
lesions, root canal treatment defects, marginal defects at crown restorations,
periodontal bone loss and calculus. The study compares the detection
performance of dentists using the deep learning algorithm to the prior
performance of these dentists evaluating the images without algorithmic
assistance. Calculating the marginal profit and loss of performance from the
annotated paired image data allows for a quantification of the hypothesized
change in sensitivity and specificity. The statistical significance of these
results is extensively proven using both McNemar's test and the binomial
hypothesis test. The average sensitivity increases from $60.7\%$ to $85.9\%$,
while the average specificity slightly decreases from $94.5\%$ to $92.7\%$. We
prove that the increase of the area under the localization ROC curve (AUC) is
significant (from $0.60$ to $0.86$ on average), while the average AUC is
bounded by the $95\%$ confidence intervals ${[}0.54, 0.65{]}$ and ${[}0.82,
0.90{]}$. When using the deep learning algorithm for diagnostic guidance, the
dentist can be $95\%$ confident that the average true population sensitivity is
bounded by the range $79.6\%$ to $91.9\%$. The proposed paired data setup and
statistical analysis can be used as a blueprint to thoroughly test the effect

  Development","Zhenhuan Zhou, Yuchen Zhang, Ruihong Xu, Xuansen Zhao, Tao Li","Deep learning (DL), a pivotal technology in artificial intelligence, has
recently gained substantial traction in the domain of dental auxiliary

modalities such as panoramic radiographs and Cone Beam Computed Tomography,
with limited focus on auxiliary analysis specifically targeting Periapical
Radiographs (PR). PR are the most extensively utilized imaging modality in
endodontics and periodontics due to their capability to capture detailed local

scarcity of publicly available, large-scale, high-quality PR analysis datasets.
This scarcity has somewhat impeded the advancement of DL applications in PR

PRAD-10K comprises 10,000 clinical periapical radiograph images, with
pixel-level annotations provided by professional dentists for nine distinct

"A reference-invariant health disparity index based on Rényi
  divergence",Makram Talih,"One of four overarching goals of Healthy People 2020 (HP2020) is to achieve
health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups. In
health disparity indices (HDIs) such as the mean log deviation (MLD) and Theil
index (TI), disparities are relative to the population average, whereas in the
index of disparity (IDisp) the reference is the group with the least adverse
health outcome. Although the latter may be preferable, identification of a
reference group can be affected by statistical reliability. To address this
issue, we propose a new HDI, the R\'{e}nyi index (RI), which is
reference-invariant. When standardized, the RI extends the Atkinson index,
where a disparity aversion parameter can incorporate societal values associated
with health equity. In addition, both the MLD and TI are limiting cases of the
RI. Also, a symmetrized R\'{e}nyi index (SRI) can be constructed, resulting in
a symmetric measure in the two distributions whose relative entropy is being
evaluated. We discuss alternative symmetric and reference-invariant HDIs
derived from the generalized entropy (GE) class and the Bregman divergence, and
argue that the SRI is more robust than its GE-based counterpart to small
changes in the distribution of the adverse health outcome. We evaluate the
design-based standard errors and bootstrapped sampling distributions for the
SRI, and illustrate the proposed methodology using data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) on the 2001-04 prevalence of
moderate or severe periodontitis among adults aged 45-74, which track Oral
