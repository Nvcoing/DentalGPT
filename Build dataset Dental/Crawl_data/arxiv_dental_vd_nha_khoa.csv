Lyman alpha absorption lines from mini pancakes,Biman B. Nath,"[Abridged abstract:] Recent numerical simulations show that many $\lyal$
absorption lines of column densities $\nha \la 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ are produced
in transient, mini pancakes. Such pancakes are modeled here, approximating the
initial perturbation leading to the formation of the pancake as a single
sinusoidal wave. The density and temperature profiles of the gas in the pancake
are determined for $z_c \sim 3$, where $z_c$ is the collapse redshift. The
$\lyal$ absorption line profiles for a line of sight through the pancake are
then calculated. The absorption lines in general have wings signifying bulk
motions in the gas. It is shown that the deviation from a single Voigt profile
is large for small H I column density lines, in which the effect of bulk
motions is large. For lines with $\nha > 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, high temperature
tend to wash out the signatures of bulk motion. The analytical modeling of mini
pancakes associated with $\lyal$ forest lines --- with $10^{13} \la \nha \la
10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$---gives the corresponding mass scales. It is shown here
that, for typical values of cosmological parameters, absorption lines with
$\nha \sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ correspond to structures with baryonic mass of
$M_b \sim 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ with an overdensity of $\sim 10$ at $z \sim 3$.
The value of $\nha$ can change by a factor $\sim 3$ in the course of evolution
of the pancake in time. It is also shown that there is an upper limit to $\nha$
from a pancake due to the slow recombination rate and the importance of
collisional ionization at high temperatures. Mini pancakes do not give rise to
$\lyal$ lines with $\nha \ga 10^{14.5}$ cm$^{-2}$, for $\j21=1$ and
$\Omega_{IGM} \sim 0.03$.",1997-01-10T22:27:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9701054v1,nha khoa

"Unitary equivalence between ordinary intelligent states and generalized
  intelligent states",Hyunchul Nha,"Ordinary intelligent states (OIS) hold equality in the Heisenberg uncertainty
relation involving two noncommuting observables {A, B}, whereas generalized
intelligent states (GIS) do so in the more generalized uncertainty relation,
the Schrodinger-Robertson inequality. In general, OISs form a subset of GISs.
However, if there exists a unitary evolution U that transforms the operators
{A, B} to a new pair of operators in a rotation form, it is shown that an
arbitrary GIS can be generated by applying the rotation operator U to a certain
OIS. In this sense, the set of OISs is unitarily equivalent to the set of GISs.
It is the case, for example, with the su(2) and the su(1,1) algebra that have
been extensively studied particularly in quantum optics. When these algebras
are represented by two bosonic operators (nondegenerate case), or by a single
bosonic operator (degenerate case), the rotation, or pseudo-rotation, operator
U corresponds to phase shift, beam splitting, or parametric amplification,
depending on two observables {A, B}.",2007-09-20T23:04:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.3307v2,nha khoa
Complete conditions for legitimate Wigner distributions,Hyunchul Nha,"Given a real-valued phase-space function, it is a nontrivial task to
determine whether it corresponds to a Wigner distribution for a physically
acceptable quantum state. This topic has been of fundamental interest for long,
and in a modern application, it can be related to the problem of entanglement
detection for multi-mode cases. In this paper, we present a hierarchy of
complete conditions for a physically realizable Wigner distribution. Our
derivation is based on the normally-ordered expansion, in terms of annihilation
andcreation operators, of the quasi-density operator corresponding to the
phase-space function in question. As a by-product, it is shown that the
phase-space distributions with elliptical symmetry can be readily diagonalized
in our representation, facilitating the test of physical realizability. We also
illustrate how the current formulation can be connected to the detection of
bipartite entanglement for continuous variables.",2008-04-30T04:27:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.4727v3,nha khoa
Quantum linear amplifier enhanced by photon subtraction and addition,"Ho-Joon Kim, Su-Yong Lee, Se-Wan Ji, Hyunchul Nha","A deterministic quantum amplifier inevitably adds noise to an amplified
signal due to the uncertainty principle in quantum physics. We here investigate
how a quantum-noise-limited amplifier can be improved by additionally employing
the photon subtraction, the photon addition, and a coherent superposition of
the two, thereby making a probabilistic, heralded, quantum amplifier. We show
that these operations can enhance the performance in amplifying a coherent
state in terms of intensity gain, fidelity, and phase uncertainty. In
particular, the photon subtraction turns out to be optimal for the fidelity and
the phase concentration among these elementary operations, while the photon
addition also provides a significant reduction in the phase uncertainty with
the largest gain effect.",2012-01-30T07:26:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.6120v1,nha khoa
Faithful measure of Quantum non-Gaussianity via quantum relative entropy,"Jiyong Park, Jaehak Lee, Kyunghyun Baek, Se-Wan Ji, Hyunchul Nha","We introduce a measure of quantum non-Gaussianity (QNG) for those quantum
states not accessible by a mixture of Gaussian states in terms of quantum
relative entropy. Specifically, we employ a convex-roof extension using all
possible mixed-state decompositions beyond the usual pure-state decompositions.
We prove that this approach brings a QNG measure fulfilling the properties
desired as a proper monotone under Gaussian channels and conditional Gaussian
operations. As an illustration, we explicitly calculate QNG for the noisy
single-photon states and demonstrate that QNG coincides with non-Gaussianity of
the state itself when the single-photon fraction is sufficiently large.",2018-09-09T16:18:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02999v2,nha khoa
"Constructing the astronomical observatory at Tay Nguyen University,
  Vietnam","Tan Le-Minh, Lam Tran-Quoc, Quang Nguyen-Luong","We are planning to build an observatory that includes a 40 cm optical
telescope at Tay Nguyen University (TNU), Daklak Province, Vietnam. In this
paper, we report the initial activities of our project. First, to prepare for
the scientific exploitation of the observatory, we organized the observational
nights for students at the International Center for Interdisciplinary Science
and Education, Qui Nhon in April 2017 and at the Nha Trang Observatory, Nha
Trang in November 2018. These activities aim to provide students with the
skills of astronomical observations and to create their passion in astronomy
study. Second, we are organizing the annual Exploration Program in Astrophysics
Research (EPAR) at TNU. The goals of EPAR are to promote the teaching and
learning activities at TNU and promoting collaboration between TNU and other
institutes. Finally, we are conducting joint research project between TNU and
Kyoto astronomical observatory of Kyoto university to prepare for the technical
details of the observatory.",2018-12-03T18:07:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00941v1,nha khoa
Analytic Filter Function Derivatives for Quantum Optimal Control,"Isabel Nha Minh Le, Julian D. Teske, Tobias Hangleiter, Pascal Cerfontaine, Hendrik Bluhm","Auto-correlated noise appears in many solid state qubit systems and hence
needs to be taken into account when developing gate operations for quantum
information processing. However, explicitly simulating this kind of noise is
often less efficient than approximate methods. Here, we focus on the filter
function formalism, which allows the computation of gate fidelities in the
presence of auto-correlated classical noise. Hence, this formalism can be
combined with optimal control algorithms to design control pulses, which
optimally implement quantum gates. To enable the use of gradient-based
algorithms with fast convergence, we present analytically derived filter
function gradients with respect to control pulse amplitudes, and analyze the
computational complexity of our results. When comparing pulse optimization
using our derivatives to a gradient-free approach, we find that the
gradient-based method is roughly two orders of magnitude faster for our test
cases. We also provide a modular computational implementation compatible with
quantum optimal control packages.",2021-03-16T15:13:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09126v2,nha khoa

  γ$ in a minimal left-right symmetric model","T. T. Hong, V. K. Le, L. T. T. Phuong, N . C. Hoi, N. T. K. Ngan, N. H. T. Nha","Two decay channels $h\rightarrow \gamma \gamma, Z\gamma$ of the Standard
Model-like Higgs in a left-right symmetry model are investigated under recent
experimental data. We will show there exist one-loop contributions that affect
the $h\rightarrow Z\gamma$ amplitude, but not the $h\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$
amplitude. From numerical investigations, we show that the signal strength
$\mu_{Z \gamma}$ of the decay $h\rightarrow Z\gamma$ is still constrained
strictly by that of $h\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$, namely $|\Delta \mu_{\gamma
\gamma}|<38\%$ results in max $|\Delta \mu_{Z \gamma}|<46\%$. On the other
hand, the future experimental sensitivity $|\Delta \mu_{\gamma \gamma}|=4\%$
still allows $|\Delta \mu_{Z \gamma}|$ reaches to values larger than the
expected sensitivity $|\Delta \mu_{Z \gamma}|=23\%$.",2023-12-18T09:19:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11045v2,nha khoa
Decays $Z\to e_ae_b$ in a 3-3-1 model with neutral leptons,"T. T. Hong, L. T. Hue, L. T. T. Phuong, N. H. T. Nha, T. Phong Nguyen","We investigate the 3-3-1 model with neutral leptons (called the 331$NL$ for
short) and by that, we will point out that this model can simultaneously
explain the lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays of the $Z$ boson $Z \to e_a
e_b$, Standard model-like Higgs boson decay $h\to e_be_a$, and the charged
leptons $e_b\to e_a \gamma$ consistent with the recent experimental data. In
addition, the numerical results show strict relations among these decay rates
of $Z$ and $h$ which are predicted by this model. As a result, the decay
channels can be determined theoretically if one of them is detected by
experiments.",2024-06-16T18:41:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11040v3,nha khoa
